REUTERS/Dado RuvicJuly 12 (Reuters) - The bidding war for Spirit Airlines Inc (SAVE.N) between Frontier Group Holdings Inc (ULCC.O) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) may leave the acquirer taking years to earn back their investment.JetBlues latest cash-and-stock bid values Spirit at $3.7 billion, while Frontiers latest cash-and-stock bid, which Spirit recommends its shareholders should back, is worth $2.4 billion. Spirit has delayed its shareholder vote on the deal for a third time to July 15 to negotiate further with both suitors.JetBlue and Frontier may have to wait anywhere from three to five years or even longer to recoup their investment if they are successful, according to a dozen investment bankers and analysts interviewed by Reuters.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterFrontier expects the combined company to deliver annual synergies of roughly $500 million, most of which will start kicking in roughly three or four years after the deal is completed. JetBlue says a tie-up with Spirit will deliver synergies of $600 million to $700 million the first year after integration is complete.Airline experts said the long-term synergies cited by both JetBlue and Frontier make it worth the price the companies are willing to pay for Spirit, although some analysts cautioned that the bidding war might strain their finances in the near term.""We are probably heading into a recession. This is not the right time to borrow a lot of money to buy a competitor,"" said Israel Shaked, professor emeritus of finance at Boston University.Spirit, JetBlue and Frontier declined to comment.For an interactive graphic, click on this link: https://tmsnrt.rs/3AwXtq0EXPENSIVE BETThe bidding war began in February this year, when Frontier offered to buy Spirit. Two months later, JetBlue swooped in with an all-cash, unsolicited bid worth $3.6 billion for Spirit that was higher than the price Frontier had offered.Since then, both sides have engaged in a game of one-upmanship and made competing offers for Spirit that have included sweeteners such as higher break-up fees and route divestitures, which were aimed at easing regulatory concerns.Frontier, which has so far been unable to garner enough shareholder support for its proposal, earlier on Monday urged Spirit to extend the shareholder voting deadline to July 27, saying its last proposal was its ""best and final offer"" and that it was waiving its right to match JetBlues most recent offer.The airline industry is grappling with high fuel prices, pilot shortages and flight cancellations as it tackles a rebound in travel demand more than two years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A tie-up with Spirit would give the winning suitor more scale and resources to deal with these challenges.Raymond James & Associates airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said the deal made sense long-term even though it was expensive.""This is a more expensive deal, at 17 times price-to-earnings, than the deal for Virgin America at 15.5 times,"" Syth said, referring to the bidding war in 2016 between Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK.N) and JetBlue that ended with Alaska buying Virgin America in a $2.6 billion deal.Alaska made its deal work. Since taking over Virgin America, it has won market share against low-cost competitors and paid down debt it raised to finance the acquisition, analysts said.JetBlue is making the same gamble. It will be assuming $3.5 billion of new debt to finance its bid for Spirit. Analysts and management experts pointed out that in the event of a global recession, a highly levered balance sheet could weigh heavily on JetBlues financial performance, diminishing its earnings power.""Recessions are always very tricky environments for airlines,"" said Florian Ederer, associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management. ""We went through a whole range of bankruptcies in previous recessions for airlines.""Frontier will not be stretching itself as much. It had $727 million in cash and long-term debt of roughly $207 million as of March 31.It is possible the bidding war reaches price levels that would cause one suitor to bow out, said Helane Becker, managing director and senior research analyst at Cowen.""At some point, one or the other (Frontier or JetBlue) will drop out because Spirit might become overvalued. We don’t believe it is there yet, but we’ll have to see what happens,"" Becker said.Frontier has an advantage in that its bid is seen by Spirit as more likely to be cleared by antitrust regulators than a tie-up with JetBlue. JetBlues current Northeast Alliance with American Airlines is already in the crosshairs of the regulators - in June, a U.S. judge said the Justice Departments antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and JetBlue would move forward.Spirit has, so far, said that a deal is not possible unless JetBlue drops that partnership.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Anirban Sen, Angelique Chen and David Carnevali in New York Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Rowe Price Group.SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, are publicly-listed shells of cash that are created by large investors - known as sponsors - for the sole purpose of merging with a private company. The process, which is similar to a reverse merger, takes the target company public.SPACs peaked during 2020 and the early part of 2021, helping rake in paper gains worth hundreds of millions of dollars for a number of prominent SPAC creators like Michael Klein and Chamath Palihapitiya.However, over the past year, companies that merged with SPACs have performed poorly, forcing investors to shun blank-check deals. That coupled with tighter regulatory scrutiny and a downturn in equity markets have practically shut down the SPAC economy, with several billions of dollars at stake.Moreover, the record-breaking performance of regular IPOs in the United States in 2021 posed competitive challenges for SPAC sponsors like Ackman, as several richly valued startups chose to list their shares on exchanges through traditional routes instead.""The rapid recovery of the capital markets and our economy were good for America but unfortunate for PSTH, as it made the conventional IPO market a strong competitor and a preferred alternative for high-quality businesses seeking to go public,"" Ackman said.In July last year, Ackmans efforts to take a 10% stake in Universal Music, which was being spun off by French media conglomerate Vivendi, through his SPAC were derailed due to regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission objected to the deal and Ackman put the investment into his hedge fund instead.""While there were transactions that were potentially actionable for PSTH during the past year, none of them met our investment criteria,"" Ackman said.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Muralikumar AnantharamanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

After the deal closes, Potash shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company, while Agrium’s investors will own 48 percent. The stocks of both companies declined on Monday, with Agrium about 3 percent lower, and Potash slipping more than 1.5 percent. One possibility for the declines: The deal does not have a premium.The combination would help Potash, which produces half the potash in North America, reduce its exposure to volatile prices for the potassium product. Agrium has a big presence among farm-retail chains, enabling it to produce more stable earnings than wholesale fertilizer, according to a Sept. 1 report by Fitch Ratings after word of preliminary talks between the two companies came out. A combination “will improve market reach and allow the company to optimize its product margins,” Monica Bonar, a senior director at Fitch, said in the report.The deal follows others that involve the farming industry, including the pending merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont to create a company that would eventually break into three parts, one of which would focus on agricultural chemicals. In addition, China National Chemical Corporation, or ChemChina, has agreed to acquire seed and farm chemicals producer Syngenta. And the German industrial giant Bayer has been in back-and-forth negotiations with Monsanto, the American company known for its genetically modified crop seeds.Some farm groups have raised concerns about the effect of a merger of Agrium and Potash on fertilizer prices.

merger,https://time.com/5715804/fiat-chrysler-psa-peugeot/,3 Reasons a Fiat Chrysler-Peugeot Merger Makes Sense,"Chrysler is considered one of the United States’ “Big Three” automakers, but it has cast its gaze overseas to build its future. The company has had two major mergers with European automakers in a little more than a decade — first, a failed 1998 marriage with German automaker Daimler, and then a somewhat more harmonious 2009 union with Italy’s Fiat, turning it into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, or FCA. Now, the company is planning to go to the altar for a third time, with French manufacturer Groupe PSA, best known for its Peugeot brand.Industry experts warn that mergers are always a challenge. As in the case of Daimler, a cultural mismatch between two companies can cause friction, and worse. However, experts say that a super-sized FCA-PSA that pools the resources and strengths of the two automakers may be better able to invest in new technologies and compete globally.Here’s why experts say a merger may be just what Fiat Chrysler and PSA both need.Merging can help both companies innovateErik Gordon, of the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, says that both Fiat Chrysler and PSA are behind on technologies like electrification and safety features. Coming together could make the automakers innovate more efficiently, he says, as they can pool development resources and share designs. Manufacturing will be more efficient as well, he argues, because each company will be able to share parts and designs with the other.Gordon admits that there’s an open debate as to whether mergers actually lead to innovation. In part, that’s because companies tend to spend money elsewhere after a tie-up. However, he argues that mergers also offer companies cover to nix ideas that aren’t working out. “When you do a merger, everything is looked at,” says Gordon. “So, there’s more freedom to close things without career damage.”Harley Shaiken, a professor with expertise in labor and globalization at the University of California-Berkeley, says that it’s important that post-merger companies focus not just on efficiency, but also on “vision” — creating innovative, well-marketed products that people want to buy.Shaiken says PSA has already shown signs that it’s capable of acquiring and turning around ailing assets. In 2017, it purchased two struggling car brands — Opel and Vauxhall — from General Motors. A year later, both brands were profitable again.It’s a chance to reset their relationship with workersShaiken says that the merger could be an opportunity to hit the reset button on Fiat Chrysler’s battered relationship with United Auto Workers (UAW) and the company’s employees, which has suffered mightily amid a corruption scandal. “It could be very good news for workers, for their communities, and for a more competitive auto firm,” says Shaiken.If the combined company chooses to build its new technologies in the United States, it could bolster their relationship with workers. Of course, the company could decide to shrink U.S. production, but he says that such a move would be “short-sighted.” Maintaining a relationship with workers is essential to keeping them motivated and encouraging innovation, he argues. “It’s something companies take for granted at their own peril,” Shaiken says.However, Gordon says that he doubts that the deal will have much of an impact on the issues that most concern workers. With or without the merger, he believes it’s likely that Fiat Chrysler will need to reduce its domestic workforce because Americans are buying few of Chrysler’s small cars, focusing instead on larger SUVs and trucks like those from the company’s Jeep brand.The merger will help them compete on a global levelIf the two companies merge, the new company would be among the largest automakers in the world. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for Autotrader, says that such massive size could be a big advantage as it plans for the future. “The thinking is that you really need to be a big company to compete on a global basis,” Krebs says.Pooling resources will enable the company not only invest in new technology such as autonomous and electric vehicles, but also to take advantage of different markets. Chrysler has a stronger foothold in the United States, where Peugeot has no presence, while Peugeot is in a strong position in Europe.The merger may also help them to move into another market where neither company has much of a presence: China.“As a global automaker, you can’t ignore China. It’s the biggest market in the world, by a very wide margin,” says Krebs. “It’s also the largest market for electric vehicles. So if you’re going to be a true global automaker, you need to have strength in China.”Contact us at letters@time.com."

On Friday, those critics, a group that includes attorneys general from several states and Democratic presidential candidates, continued to voice their objections to the deal, saying the combination would harm consumers.Until recently, the Justice Department shared those concerns. In a news briefing on Friday, Makan Delrahim, the Trump administration’s top antitrust regulator, said the agency had only decided to approve the deal after T-Mobile and Sprint agreed last week to sell off significant portions of their businesses to the pay-television operator Dish Network as part of a plan to create a potential new major wireless company.

The merger gives Denver-based Frontier Airlines a 51.5% controlling stake in the combined airline. Spirit investors will receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each share they own, giving Spirit shareholders an implied value of $25.83 per share, which is a 19% premium over the value of Spirit shares at the end of last week, the companies said. ""The transaction is centered around creating an aggressive low-fare competitor that will better serve guests, expand career opportunities for our team members and create value for our shareholders,"" Ted Christie, CEO of Miramar, Fla.-based Spirit, told analysts on a call discussing the deal on Monday. ""We believe we are a perfect fit with Frontier. Our businesses share similar values, including our long-standing commitment to affordable travel.""The boards of both companies approved the deal over the weekend. It would be the first merger of large U.S. airlines since Alaska Airlines combination with Virgin America in 2016 and a test of the Biden administrations tolerance for consolidation, particularly among airlines, one of the most scrutinized industries by antitrust regulators.Spirits shares soared more than 17% after the deal was announced, closing at $25.46, while Frontiers ended the day $12.82 up 3.5%. Frontier Chairman Bill Franke, a longtime discount airline investor and executive, will chair the combined company, which he said ""will create Americas most competitive ultra-low fare airline for the benefit of consumers."" The companies didnt announce the new name of the combined carrier, the CEO or location of the airlines headquarters. Those questions will be answered by a committee led by Franke after the transaction closes, which is expected in the second half of the year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Labor unions were informed early Monday, the airlines said. Pilots at Frontier and Spirit are represented by the same union, as are the two airlines flight attendants. The deal comes as carriers are still struggling to recover from the pandemic. Fast-growing discount airlines such as Spirit and Frontier that focus on price-sensitive leisure travelers have been able to weather the crisis better than their larger-carrier competitors, which are more reliant for revenue on international and business travel, two segments that have lagged in the recovery. That has meant U.S. airlines large and small have been going after domestic leisure travelers, redrawing their networks in the process, to help dig themselves out of pandemic losses. For Franke, the deal is the latest in a career of making investments in and overseeing low-fare airlines around the world, including Spirit. His empire of ultralow-cost airlines includes Hungarys Wizz Air, Chilean carrier Jetsmart and Volaris in Mexico. From 2006 through 2013, Indigo Partners held a stake in Spirit, with Franke serving as chair of the airline before he resigned when Indigo sold its position in the carrier. Shortly after that move, Indigo bought Frontier Airlines from Republic Airways for $145 million.Spirit Airlines aircraft are seen parked at the end of a runway at Orlando International Airport on the sixth day the airline has cancelled hundreds of flights. Paul Hennessy | LightRocket | Getty ImagesSince that acquisition, Frontier has steadily expanded its route network with new destinations and additional flights, often targeting cities where larger airlines such as Southwest have a strong presence. In almost every case, Frontier enters with low fares to gain a foothold with price-conscious travelers. Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit has also been aggressively expanding in the last decade, including in much larger rivals hubs, and plans to continue that strategy once it combines with Frontier. The two airlines had been having deal talks ""in earnest"" since late last year, Christie said. The two carriers overlap on about 520 of more than 2,800 routes, according to aviation data and consulting firm Cirium. ""Spirit is very strong in the East. Frontier is very strong in the West,"" Biffle told analysts on a call discussing the deal. ""Thats going to drive more customers onto our existing flights, which means more low fares to more people."" The carriers said the deal would allow them to continue growing and that they plan to add 10,000 new jobs by 2026. Frontier said it doesnt expect there to be any furloughs and told its flight attendants that it anticipates ""maintaining all of our current bases and growing them over time."" The tight labor market has challenged airlines recovery plans in the pandemic. ""It makes a lot of sense and the opportunity has been ripened by the demand patterns of the pandemic,"" said Samuel Engel, senior vice president at consulting firm ICF. In 2013, Spirit and Frontier had 2.8% of the revenue passenger miles flown by U.S. airlines, according to the Department of Transportation. By 2019, their combined market share had almost doubled to 5.4% while the four largest airlines in the U.S., American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United and Southwest, controlled 73.9% of revenue passenger miles."

merger,https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace,The Pfizer–Allergan Merger Is a Disgrace,"Ian Read, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, says merging with Allergan would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.” Photograph by Ben Cawthra / Rex Features via APIn an announcement on Monday morning, Pfizer, the big drug company, whose headquarters are on East 42nd Street, in Manhattan, said that it is merging with one of its competitors, Allergan PLC. Ian Read, a Scottish-born accountant who is Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said that the proposed deal, which is valued at a hundred and sixty billion dollars, would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”On Wall Street and in the world of big pharma, that statement will raise chuckles. It is widely acknowledged that the primary impetus for the deal is a financial one. In merging with Allergan, which is based in Dublin, Pfizer intends to move its corporate residency to Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 per cent, compared to thirty-five per cent for a company of its size in the United States. Over the next few years, the merger could save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes and deprive the U.S. Treasury of the same amount.Tax-driven deals of this nature are known as “inversions,” and they are becoming increasingly common. Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad. Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said that inversions were “wrong,” and that he would try and restrict them. Only last week, the Treasury Department issued some new administrative guidelines in this area. Without actual legislation, though, there isn’t very much the Obama Administration can do to prevent these exercises in corporate tax-dodging, and Republicans on Capitol Hill have displayed little eagerness to coöperate in a crackdown.The Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace. Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Now, Pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, particularly profits generated by its overseas subsidiaries. Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.Founded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals. Its first commercial product was an anti-parasitic pill designed to fight intestinal worms, which were a common affliction at the time. In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills. During the Second World War, it developed a new way of making penicillin, which was then seen as a miracle drug. After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine. During the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it invested heavily in R. & D., boosting its research budget to about twenty per cent of its sales. These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction). In 1999, when Pfizer celebrated its hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it was widely seen as the leading drug company in the world.Pfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research. Since 2010, though, when Read took over as chief executive, it has cut its R. & D. budget significantly and raised its spending on stock buybacks. Under Read’s leadership, cost-cutting and financial engineering have sometimes seemed to be driving the company’s strategy. To some extent, these kinds of changes were unavoidable. As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.So, like many other big American corporations, Pfizer is facing challenges adapting to a changed world. But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails. A venerable member of the Fortune 500 now looks for all the world like a greedy tax exile, skipping off to a dodgy foreign locale. (Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is distinctly dodgy.)Read, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergan, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States. However, there is scant evidence that being based in the United States has handicapped Pfizer or made it more difficult for the company to raise capital.To the contrary, being based in the United States enables Pfizer to exploit the vast reservoirs of technical expertise that reside here, and to access federal support for scientific research. For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health. And being headquartered in the United States certainly hasn’t prevented Pfizer from making a lot of money. Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.All things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity. If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through. Its lead independent director is Dennis Ausiello, an eminent physician who, for many years, was chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other non-executives on the Pfizer board include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital. These directors are all experienced, worldly individuals. Last year, according to Pfizer’s 2015 proxy statement, they were each paid more than three hundred thousand dollars to carry out their duties, which include overseeing the company’s full-time management and protecting the long-term interests of all of its stakeholders: employees, shareholders, and customers.One of those key interests, surely, is safeguarding Pfizer’s reputation, which has already suffered in recent years, following a big marketing scandal over the since-discontinued painkiller Bextra and other missteps. Read has for years been telling shareholders in his annual letter to them that “earning greater respect from society” is one of Pfizer’s strategic imperatives. One of the ways the company could do this, he said, was through “acting as a respectable corporate citizen.” So here is a question for the independent directors: Do you really think that traducing Pfizer’s proud history by moving to Dublin and shafting American taxpayers would be the act of a “respectable corporate citizen”?"

The new companys name will be Raytheon Technologies Corp. — and its expected to have nearly $74 billion in annual sales.The new defense and aerospace company would be second only to Boeing in the U.S., according to the latest Forbes 500 rankings by annual revenue. On that list, Boeing had more than $101 billion in revenue while another rival, Lockheed Martin, racked up $53.7 billion, according to Forbes.""The combination of United Technologies and Raytheon will define the future of aerospace and defense,"" United Technologies Chairman and CEO Greg Hayes said in a statement about the deal.Hayes is set to become the leader of the new company: Hell take the titles of chairman and CEO two years after the merger is finalized.Under the deal, United Technologies shareholders will own about 57% and Raytheon shareholders will own about 43% of the merged company. Both Raytheons and United Technologies board of directors have unanimously approved the merger, which is expected to close during the first half of 2020.The headquarters of Raytheon Technologies will be in the Boston metro area, the companies say. Raytheon is currently based in Waltham, Mass., while United Technologies is based in Farmington, Conn.The deal brings together two companies that have been integral to the U.S. technological explosion in the past nearly 100 years. United Technologies list of accomplishments range from transmitting the first photo via satellite to receiving the first GPS signal. Raytheons engineers invented both the microwave oven and the Patriot missile. In 1997, Raytheon acquired trailblazing Hughes Aircraft, which was founded by late billionaire Howard Hughes.""Raytheon Technologies will continue a legacy of innovation with an expanded aerospace and defense portfolio supported by the worlds most dedicated workforce,"" said Tom Kennedy, Raytheons current chairman and CEO.

Those entities will join Collins Aerospace (the recently acquired Rockwell Collins Inc.) and jet engine-maker Pratt & Whitney — two of United Technologies high-revenue divisions.""By joining forces, we will have unsurpassed technology and expanded R&D capabilities,"" Hayes said. ""Merging our portfolios will also deliver cost and revenue synergies that will create long-term value for our customers and shareowners.""By the time the deal closes, United Technologies is expected to have finished spinning off its Otis and Carrier businesses — a move that was announced previously as part of a focus on aerospace and engines."
merger,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-merger.html,Justice Department Sues to Block AT&T-Time Warner Merger,"Mr. Stephenson has argued that AT&T needs media content in order to compete against internet firms like Google and Facebook for digital advertising dollars. With a big stock of television programming, it would also compete more effectively for subscribers against companies like Comcast and Verizon, which both own content.While speaking with reporters on Monday, Mr. Stephenson obliquely raised the issue of possible interference by the White House. President Trump, a frequent critic of news coverage by CNN, said during the 2016 presidential campaign that the deal should be blocked. Mr. Stephenson called the issue of CNN the “elephant in the room” and speculated about its role in Mr. Delrahim’s decision.“Frankly, I don’t know,” Mr. Stephenson said.Mr. Delrahim has spoken at length about how Justice Department officials should handle mergers involving two companies that don’t compete against each other, like the one between AT&T and Time Warner. Problems with those mergers have traditionally been resolved by adding conditions known as consent decrees, which restrict the new company’s behavior or operations.Mr. Delrahim has argued that those remedies are not effective. Instead, he has spoken in favor of so-called structural remedies, like forcing a company to sell assets before a merger or acquisition.On Sept. 29, he was put in a position to act on that theory, when he was sworn in at the Justice Department.Throughout the summer, Justice Department officials and AT&T lawyers had discussed conditions that would allay antitrust concerns. During the talks, AT&T representatives said the combined company would abstain from anticompetitive business practices. At least some Justice Department staff members seemed open to the idea, according to two people familiar with the government review."

Inc. The Boston Beer Co. Inc.Two major craft beer companies are joining forces.Dogfish Head Brewery and The Boston Beer Co. — the maker of Samuel Adams Boston Lager — announced Thursday that they have reached an agreement to merge. The deal, which is expected to close late in the second quarter of this year, is valued at about $300 million in cash and stock.The companies founders say the merger is going to help the craft brewers compete in an industry that is seeing rapid consolidation. Industry giants have been acquiring smaller breweries. For example, AB InBev (Anheuser-Busch) now owns Goose Island Beer Co. and Golden Road Brewing.""More than a dozen of our peers have sold to international conglomerates, others have come together through platforms bringing a handful of craft breweries together in roll-ups,"" the founders of Dogfish Head, Sam and Mariah Calagione, said in a statement. ""While neither of those strategies appealed to us, we did realize that Dogfish Head would be a stronger company with the support of our friends at Boston Beer, and vice-versa.""Boston Beer founder Jim Koch says he found a kindred spirit in Sam Calagione. ""Just as important as our passion for brewing is our commitment to championing and preserving the independent, American craft movement,"" he wrote.Koch founded his company in 1984, and since then it has grown to include brands such as Angry Orchard Hard Cider, Twisted Tea and Truly Hard Seltzer. Dogfish Head, which is based in Delaware, opened 23 years ago and is known for its IPAs and sour beers, often brewed with unusual ingredients.The companies are both defined as craft brewers by the Brewers Association, meaning they are independent and produce fewer than 6 million barrels of beer each year. In 2018, Boston Beer Co. was the second-largest craft beer company in the country by sales volume, while Dogfish Head was 13th.The companies say they will retain their status as independent craft brewers.In a statement, the companies said that Dogfish Head is expected to sell nearly 300,000 barrels this year, which would signal ""high single digit growth versus the prior full year."" Boston is projecting that the ""transaction will be neutral to slightly accretive in 2019 and will not have a material impact on full-year 2019 earnings per diluted share.""Sam and Mariah Calagione will take nearly all of their proceeds from the merger — an estimated $128 million — in stock of the combined company, and Sam Calagione will join the board of directors of Boston Beer in 2020. The Dogfish Head shareholders are expected to receive $173 million in cash. The merged company is going to be led by the current CEO of Boston Beer, Dave Burwick."

The expanded Woodside will be 52% owned by existing Woodside shareholders and 48% by existing BHP shareholders.The transaction will deliver significant benefits for both Woodside and BHP shareholders by creating a long-life conventional portfolio of scale and diversity of geography, product and end markets, the companies said.On a proforma basis, the combined business will command a high quality conventional asset base producing around 200 million barrels of oil equivalent (as per financial year 2021 net production), 10.6 million mt of LNG output at a portfolio unit production cost of $8/boe, Woodside said.The combined portfolio will comprise a production mix of 46% LNG, 29% oil and condensate and 25% domestic gas and liquids (FY21 net production) that spans Australia, the US Gulf of Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago with 94% from OECD nations.Oil and gas playsIn the US Gulf of Mexico, BHP owns a stake in the BP-operated Mad Dog phase two oil project, which is on track for first oil in 2022 and had sanctioned the Shenzi North tie-back development aimed at starting production in 2024. Mad Dog and Shenzi ranked among the largest producing fields in the US Gulf.Off Senegal, Woodside has embarked on the Sangomar oil and gas development that is projected to come online in 2023.The combined entity will also boast 2P (proven and probable) reserves of over 2 billion boe comprising 59% gas, and 41% liquids, the companies said.They include the resources earmarked for the Scarborough field development that will support the addition of a second train of 5 million my/year capacity at the Pluto LNG complex in Western Australia.Gas in the field contains just 0.1% CO2, the lowest in carbon intensity among LNG developments in Australia, according to the presentation.""The proposed transaction de-risks and supports Scarborough FID later this year and enables more flexible capital allocation,"" ONeill said.Woodside and BHP as project partners have developed a plan to targeted final investment decision for Scarborough (Australia) by the end of 2021, prior to the proposed completion date for the merger.""Apart from Scarborough, Woodside does not have a lot of viable growth options and petroleum isnt really a core part of BHPs portfolio nowadays. An incidental benefit for Woodside is also getting Scarborough sanctioned,"" said Graeme Bethune, CEO at Australian energy consultancy EnergyQuest.When asked about the combined oil and gas capabilities of BHP and Woodside, he said they would be good but Woodside will have to manage a much more diverse international portfolio than it has now, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago.One of the issues is that the Australian assets are pretty mature, Bethune said.Sustainable business, ESGONeill said Woodside expected to stick to its emission targets and the proposed transaction will not increase actual global emission.Woodside has pledged previously to reduce net emissions by 15% and 30% by 2025 and 2030, respectively, on the pathway to its ambition of net-zero by 2050.Progress will be reported on both an operated and non-operated equity emissions basis. In support of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, and to contribute to the energy transition, the combined business will focus on building and maintaining a high return and carbon-resilient portfolio, which includes natural gas and new energy technologies.The combined business is expected to generate significant cash flow this decade to support the development of new energy products and low carbon solutions including hydrogen, ammonia and carbon capture and storage."
merger,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/rite-aid-and-albertsons-agree-to-terminate-their-merger.html,Rite Aid and Albertsons agree to terminate their merger agreement,"Rite Aid Corporation and Albertsons Companies announced on Wednesday they are terminating their merger agreement, the evening ahead of a shareholder vote over the deal.The announcement is a blow to the pharmacy and the grocer, which are both facing mightier competitors in their respective industries, but were unable to structure a deal that sufficiently appealed to investors.The $24 billion deal, announced in February, has faced push-back from a number of retail investors as well as top ten shareholder Highfields Capital Management. Critics have argued the deal provides Albertsons private equity owner, Cerberus Capital Management, a vehicle to take the company public without rewarding Rite Aid shareholders in turn.Adding to mounting challenges, influential investor advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services in July urged investors to vote against the tie-up.Albertsons, though, said Wednesday it was unwilling to renogotiate the terms of the deal""After careful consideration of all information available to our board of directors through today, we were unwilling to change the terms of the merger,"" it said in a statement.Rite Aid CEO John Standley, meantime, said in a statement, ""While we believed in the merits of the combination with Albertsons, we have heard the views expressed by our stockholders and are committed to moving forward and executing our strategic plan as a standalone company.""Rite Aid also said Wednesday that its board is ""evaluating governance changes at the company."" The company added it will ""continue to engage with stockholders"" as it evaluates those changes. Neither Rite Aid nor Albertsons will pay a break-up fee.The pharmacy will hold an annual meeting Oct. 30, 2018.Shares of Rite Aid closed Wednesday at $1.74 a share, up 1.16 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $1.86 billion. Its shares had tumbled roughly 24 percent since it announced the deal in February.Albertsons was formed by Cerberus and a consortium of investors in 2006. The investment firm later merged Albertsons with the grocer Safeway in 2015. But plans to take Albertsons public were sidelined by market volatility and, later, Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods that upended the grocery market.The grocer has also stumbled in comparison to its peers like Kroger, which has had positive same-store sales the past two fiscal years, ISS said. Albertsons, by contrast, showed same-store sale growth in the most recent two quarters, preceded by negative same-store sales in the past two fiscal years, ISS said.The grocer is also highly leveraged, with $12 billion in long-term debt and capitalized leases.Rite Aid has had its own challenges. Regulators thwarted its attempts to sell to Walgreens Boots Alliance, forcing them to whittle down a sale of Rite Aids entire 4,600 store footprint to just 1,932 locations. Its competitors, which now include a larger Walgreens and a proposed CVS Health-Aetna tie-up, dwarf it in size.It earlier this week cut its 2019 guidance, citing pressure from generic-drug makers.Still, investors and shareholder advisory firms weres unsure the deal as structured, and the $375 million in cost-savings the retailers say it will generate, would sufficiently absolve them of their woes.""Strategically, the proposed merger appears to be a step in the right direction, as it provides [Rite Aid] with increased scale and diversification. However, the transaction would introduce a new set of risks associated with the grocery business, and the combined companys leverage could limit investment in two evolving business environments,"" ISS wrote.ISS also said that potential conflicts of interest in the negotiating process ""heightened"" its concerns about the deals benefit for Rite Aid shareholders. Among them, Albertsons notified Rite Aid CEO it would like him to be chief executive of the combined company, while still negotiating the deal. Rite Aid later created a negotiating committee that excluded Standley, to negotiate with Albertsons."

It underscores the growing use of mergers and acquisitions as a way to slash corporate America’s tax bill.“The whole structure of this is very, very tax efficient and one of the reasons we are doing it this way, so very beneficial from that standpoint to the shareholders,” DuPont CEO Ed Breen told analysts on Friday. “When I looked at every other strategic option to DuPont, there was nothing that came close to this.”Unlike the Pfizer-Allergan deal, where the savings are the result of Pfizer redomiciling to Ireland where Allergan is based in a so-called inversion, the Dow-DuPont tax savings hinge on their transaction being structured as a merger of equals, a rare event that requires companies of the same size and scope willing to negotiate it, according to tax experts. Both companies are now valued at about $60 billion each.“It is fairly rare,” said Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting consultant. It’s unusual for two companies of roughly equal size in the same industry to negotiate such a deal, he said.Typically, companies that have been through a change of control are liable to pay capital gains taxes on subsequent spin-offs, under section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. If both companies, however, do not formally undergo a change of control, the spin-offs can be tax-free.After their merger, Dow and DuPont plan to create three publicly-traded businesses, focusing on agriculture, materials and specialty products. They plan to argue that no change of control will have occurred by structuring their initial deal as a merger of equals. Bolstering their view that a change of control has not occurred is that the two companies have many shareholders in common.Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors, Capital World Investors and BlackRock Inc are, in that order, the top holders of both companies’ stock.The companies haven’t disclosed estimates for tax savings. People familiar with the deal said the savings will far exceed the $3 billion in annual cost synergies that the companies expect.Tax experts say there is some, albeit limited precedent to this. The most famous case where this deal structure was used was the 2007 merger of drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp and Kindred Healthcare Inc, which the companies used to then spin off their institutional pharmacy businesses.William Curry, Dow’s chief tax officer, played a key role in structuring the tax aspects of the deal with DuPont, according to the sources. Earlier this year, he orchestrated the separation of a portion of Dow’s century-old chlorine business and sale to Olin Corp in a tax-efficient deal worth $5 billion.Dow and DuPont declined to comment on the tax aspects of their deal.(This story corrects DuPont CEO’s surname to Breen from Breene in paragraph 3)"

Upon merging, FaZe Clan said it is expected to have a valuation of approximately $1 billion. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Los Angeles-based company, founded in 2010, is known for its contracts with gaming content creators and professional esports athletes, as well as its various deals with traditional sports athletes and well-known brands like the fast food chain McDonald’s. It plans to merge with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corp., a SPAC paid for by B. Riley Financial, a financial services provider that has brought other companies to market with this method.FaZe Clan CEO Lee Trink estimates the deal could be completed by early next year.SPACs are so-called “blank-check” firms that raise funds for private companies to go public. SPACs are organized to acquire a private company and bring it to market faster and with less paperwork. The deal between FaZe and B. Riley Financial is one of many SPAC deals that have flooded the market during the pandemic, as investors increasingly see video games and the surrounding culture as an untapped opportunity.“A lot of the criticism on SPACs is that there are so many companies that are pre-revenue that are using SPACs as a vehicle, which is not us,” Trink said in an interview with The Washington Post Monday. “We’ve had a great revenue growth story for the last few years, and we have line of sight to grow year over year, increase revenue. For us, the reason why this vehicle works was not only was it a faster way to get to market, but it allows us to tell our story and educate the market.”AdvertisementB. Riley Financial’s CEO and CFO, Dan Shribman, said in a statement that working with FaZe Clan is a way to reach Generation Z audiences and expand content across gaming, entertainment and the developing metaverse. “We believe FaZe Clan is a compelling investment with the potential to create significant value,” he said.In an investor presentation, FaZe estimated that it has an audience of 350 million followers across social media, including Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Twitch. Eighty percent of its audience is between the ages of 13 and 34 years old.Analysts are divided on whether FaZe Clan will generate enough revenue to justify its high valuation. The company projects it will make $50 million in revenue this year and just under $300 million of the $1 billion valuation will be in cash, raised partly by FaZe Clan and partly by B. Riley Financial.Advertisement“Twenty times that [$50 million in] revenue, while rich, is certainly within an acceptable range of valuations,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who specializes in the video game market. “It really depends on how fast they can grow.”FaZe Clan lists in its risk factors that it has operating losses and is not profitable yet. It also states that much of its business relies on “a limited number of esports professionals, influencers and content creators.”Joost van Dreunen, lecturer on the business of games at NYU Stern School of Business, said that the roughly $700 million of FaZe’s valuation not covered by cash is “only reasonable if you look at FaZe with the same lens as a traditional sports team.”“Using a SPAC at a time when the popularity of such a financial vehicle has started to fade makes me wonder if leadership just wanted to get it on the books before the window of opportunity closes. It also tells you that there’s been less scrutiny along the way,” said van Dreunen. “To me, this public listing is very high risk for incoming investors, despite an otherwise well-deserved payday for the team itself.”AdvertisementTrink, FaZe Clan’s CEO, emphasized that his company was not just an esports brand.“While esports is a really important part of our brand, it’s a very minimal part of our business. … Esports is a challenging business, which is why we don’t rest the entirety of the business on that revenue,” he said.When asked whether, in the future, to please investors and reflect a healthy bottom line, FaZe might consider changing the terms of its contracts with esports athletes to take a larger cut of winnings, Trink said he would not make such a change.“No, that’s not going to increase our revenue. That’s a losing proposition, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The idea that we’re going to increase our revenue in a meaningful way by taking more out of our talent is actually the opposite way we think. This is going to be an opportunity for our talent to earn the right to have a more fruitful career, to be able to be involved in many more things. Now we’re going to have capital in order to do interesting ideas, expand their brands.”GiftOutline Gift Article"
merger,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-us-sugar-s-proposed-acquisition-imperial-sugar,Justice Department Sues to Block U.S. Sugar’s Proposed Acquisition of Imperial Sugar,"The Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today to stop United States Sugar Corporation (U.S. Sugar) from acquiring its rival, Imperial Sugar Company (Imperial Sugar). The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleges that the transaction would leave an overwhelming majority of refined sugar sales across the Southeast in the hands of only two producers. As a result, American businesses and consumers would pay more for refined sugar, a significant input for many foods and beverages.“Robust antitrust enforcement is an essential pillar of the Justice Department’s commitment to ensuring economic opportunity and fairness for all,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “We will not hesitate to challenge anticompetitive mergers that would harm American consumers and businesses alike.”“U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar are already multibillion-dollar corporations and are seeking to further consolidate an already cozy sugar industry. Their merger would eliminate aggressive competition in the supply of refined sugar that leads to lower prices, better quality, and more reliable service,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This deal substantially lessens competition at a time when global supply chain challenges already threaten steady access to important commodities and goods. The department’s lawsuit seeks to preserve the important competition between U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar and protect the resiliency of American domestic sugar supply.”According to the department’s complaint, U.S. Sugar operates a large sugar refinery in Florida, and sells all of its refined sugar through United Sugars Corporation (United Sugars), a marketing cooperative owned by U.S. Sugar and three other refined sugar producers. Imperial Sugar operates its own sugar refinery in Georgia, and sells its refined sugar directly to customers. American Sugar Refining, known more commonly by its “Domino” brand name, is the other producer supplying a significant share of refined sugar in the southeastern United States. The complaint further alleges that United Sugars and Imperial Sugar compete head-to-head to supply refined sugar to customers across the Southeast in states stretching from Mississippi to Delaware. This competition has resulted in lower prices, better-quality products and more reliable service for customers across the region.If U.S. Sugar is permitted to acquire Imperial Sugar, Imperial’s production would be folded into the United Sugars cooperative, leaving two significant sugar producers in the region. As alleged in the complaint, because transportation costs make up a significant portion of the total price customers pay for refined sugar, the nearest sugar producers tend to be a customer’s best competitive options. The complaint alleges that U.S. Sugar’s proposed acquisition of Imperial Sugar will further consolidate an already concentrated market for refined sugar. If the transaction is allowed to proceed, United Sugars and Domino would control the vast majority of refined sugar sales in the region, enhancing the likelihood going forward that they will coordinate with each other and refrain from competing aggressively.U.S. Sugar, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Florida, is the world’s largest vertically-integrated cane sugar milling and refining operation. U.S. Sugar is one of four member-owners of United Sugars. In 2020, U.S. Sugar received payments of $533 million from United Sugars, representing the company’s share of United Sugars’s net sales.United Sugars, a Minnesota corporation headquartered in Minnesota, markets and sells all of the refined sugar produced by its four member-owners — U.S. Sugar, American Crystal Sugar Company, Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative, and Wyoming Sugar Company. Its member-owners operate a total of nine sugar refineries located in Florida, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. United Sugars’s revenues were $1.8 billion in 2020.Imperial Sugar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus Company LLC, is a producer of refined sugar in the United States and independently markets and sells its products on its own behalf. Imperial Sugar has a refinery in Savannah, Georgia, and an intermediate sugar transfer and liquification facility in Ludlow, Kentucky. Imperial Sugar’s revenues were over $700 million in 2020.Louis Dreyfus Company LLC, a Delaware corporation headquartered in the Netherlands, is a worldwide leader in sugar trading and merchandising and among the largest cane sugar refiners in the world. In 2020, the company had over $33 billion in net sales."

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Under the proposed settlement filed Tuesday, Bayer will sell its seed and herbicide businesses to a third party, the German chemical company BASF. It also will sell its emerging digital farming business as well as a variety of intellectual property and R&D projects.The targeted spinoffs are aimed at preventing Bayer and Monsanto from using their combined control over seeds and seed treatments to raise the price of agricultural products to farmers and consumers, Justice Department officials said. Just six companies, including Bayer and Monsanto, have historically dominated the global trade in seeds and agrochemicals.AdvertisementThe $66 billion deal already has received approval from regulators in the European Union, Russia and Brazil, making the U.S. approval one of the last major hurdles. Bayer said it expects to complete the merger by midsummer.“Receipt of the DOJ’s approval brings us close to our goal of creating a leading company in agriculture,” Bayer chief executive Werner Baumann said in a statement.U.S. antitrust officials investigated the Bayer-Monsanto deal for more than a year, ultimately concluding that it could result in increased costs for the country’s agricultural sector.Both companies produce genetically modified cotton, canola and soybean seeds, as well as the pesticides that pair with them. Under the original deal, Bayer would have acquired a monopoly over herbicide-resistant cotton and canola in the United States and a near monopoly in some other crops, including cucumbers and carrots, the Justice Department found.Advertisement“America’s farm system is of critical importance to our economy, our food system and our way of life,” Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcer, told reporters Tuesday. “America’s farmers rely on head-to-head competition between Bayer and Monsanto.”In addition to eliminating a direct competitor in some lines of business, the deal as proposed would have led to Bayer gaining anticompetitive leverage in other markets, according to the Justice Department.By merging with Monsanto, regulators found, Bayer would become a major supplier of corn seed. After the merger, Bayer, which also sells a key seed treatment to corn farmers, would have an incentive to raise the price of the treatment knowing that farmers would have fewer choices of seed suppliers, the government alleged.AdvertisementRegulators also ruled that Bayer and Monsanto would lose motivation to develop new crops, treatments and pesticides as a result of the merger. To address those concerns, the Justice Department will require Bayer to transfer several research facilities and projects to BASF, including a research center in North Carolina and a bank of soybean tissue samples used to develop new products.“The proposed remedies will ensure that BASF can step into Bayer’s shoes, thereby preserving the competition that the merger would otherwise destroy,” the government said.Concerns about competition have grown thanks to a wave of megamergers in the agricultural industry. Regulators last year signed off on mergers between DuPont and Dow Chemical, as well as ChemChina and Syngenta, concentrating global agrochemical research and sales in the hands of five companies.AdvertisementThe Monsanto-Bayer merger will further shrink that number to four, raising questions about the future of agricultural competition and innovation. Some critics of the deal said they were not satisfied by the terms disclosed Tuesday.“Today’s news makes it clear that our antimonopoly laws are completely worthless and the U.S. Department of Justice merger review process is pointless,” said the Organization for Competitive Markets, a farm group that opposes megamergers, in a statement.Angela Huffman, a spokeswoman for the group, added that while it could not yet predict the full impact on farmers, OCM expects the deal to raise seed and pesticide costs. That probably will have little impact on consumers, given that farm expenses account for only a small portion of food prices.Bayer has defended the deal as the surest way to increase agricultural productivity as the world’s population grows, citing Monsanto’s advantage in plant genetics and Bayer’s portfolio of pesticides and other chemicals.Advertisement“Farmers will benefit from a range of new, superior solutions aimed at helping to advance the next generation of farming and to address some of society’s most pressing challenges,” the company says on a website advocating for the settlement.The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge, would be a major victory for Delrahim, who was confirmed as President Trump’s assistant attorney general for antitrust issues last summer. Delrahim has argued that selling off assets is a more effective way to resolve anticompetitive mergers than forcing companies to abide by requirements that must be reviewed by regulators on an ongoing basis.Tuesday’s settlement required close cooperation from the top executives of Bayer and Monsanto, said Justice Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door negotiations.The chief executives of both companies traveled to Washington over the Easter holiday to be briefed about the government’s concerns with the deal, the government said.GiftOutline Gift Article"

(NASDAQ: RADA, TASE: RADA) (“RADA”), a leading provider of advanced software-defined military tactical radars, and Leonardo DRS Inc. (“Leonardo DRS”), a leading mid-tier defense technology provider, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement to merge and become a combined public company (the “Combined Company”). The capabilities of the two companies are expected to generate strong growth from a wide range of new and high-growth markets, and are shaping the future battlefield for the U.S. military and its allies across all domains.Upon closing of the transaction, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, RADA will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leonardo DRS. Leonardo DRS is expected to be listed on NASDAQ and TASE under the symbol “DRS.”This transaction is anticipated to strengthen Leonardo DRS into a market leader in advanced sensing and force protection aligned to many of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. and international defense markets. RADA’s unique advanced tactical radars are complementary to Leonardo DRS and are expected to improve its position as an air defense, counter-UAS and vehicle protection integrator in the force protection market segment. For RADA, combining with Leonardo DRS is expected to significantly bolster its global competitive positioning and increase its scale, program diversity, cash generation and addressable market, providing significant future growth and value creation opportunities. Together, the Combined Company expects to be a market leader in force protection and integrated multi-domain systems, addressing global opportunities through the worldwide presence of Leonardo SpA.RADA and Leonardo DRS are strong and complementary technology companies, and their close historical relationship through collaboration on multiple programs, has resulted in a deep cultural fit. The Combined Company will work across a broad portfolio of world-class defense products, including advanced sensing, force protection, network computing and electrical power & propulsion. The Combined Company will have positions on critical force protection programs, including its partnership on the Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) and RADA positions on SOCOM SIP (special operations command system integration partner) with Anduril Industries, the USMC GBAD (ground based air defense) and the USAF ABAD (Air Base Air Defense) Programs of Record.Leonardo DRS’s parent company and sole shareholder, Leonardo SpA, is a leading global Aerospace and Defense company. Leonardo SpA’s market position will provide access to a reshaped European defense market as well as defense markets around the world, while also establishing a home market in Israel.""The combination of RADA’s tactical radar capabilities and Leonardo DRS’ strength as a premier mid-tier defense provider make the Combined Company a leader in the rapidly growing force protection market, increases our addressable market, expands international opportunities and ultimately unlocks value for shareholders,” said William J. Lynn III, CEO of Leonardo DRS. “The transaction also provides flexibility for the Combined Company to add capabilities in Leonardo DRS’ core markets through targeted acquisitions and strategic investments as we expect to supplement strong organic growth with M&A and dividend distributions as part of our overall strategy going forward.”Dov Sella, RADA’s CEO, commented: “I could not be prouder of the platform we have built throughout my nearly 20 years with RADA, culminating in this important strategic transaction with Leonardo DRS. The combination of two leading technology-focused defense companies with diversified exposure to key U.S. Department of Defense programs and an international presence creates a true win-win for RADA and Leonardo DRS shareholders. The transaction represents the first time a major U.S.-based defense company backed by a global defense prime has acquired a significant Israeli defense technology company. This unique transaction will strengthen the Israeli defense industry and set trends and direction for the future. For RADA specifically, joining forces with Leonardo DRS will significantly increase our competitiveness in the emerging and demanding markets we are addressing, which are dominated by strong and established players. We look forward to working alongside the Leonardo DRS team to continue driving innovation in the advanced sensing and force protection markets, and value creation for our shareholders.”The merger comes at a time when conflicts around the globe are highlighting the importance of the Combined Company’s solutions, including vehicle protection from missile strikes and protecting troops from aerial threats. According to Mr. Lynn, “The conflict in Ukraine has underscored the vulnerability of forces to drone attacks and has highlighted the need for modern, capable force protection systems. Not only is this accelerating U.S. purchases of these systems, but it is moving European countries, which are considerably behind in this area, to acquire more critical force protection assets. The combination of RADA and Leonardo DRS will open international market opportunities, particularly in short-range air defense, counter-UAS, counter rockets, artillery and mortars (C-RAM) and vehicle protection systems.”Beyond the current conflict in Europe, counter-terrorism and threats from China, Russia and others are expected to increase demand for the high-growth core sensing, force protection, network computing, and electrical power and propulsion technologies that the Combined Company provides. Mr. Lynn commented, “The unique defense technologies developed by the Combined Company will define the future of sensing and help to shape the future of the battlefield.”TRANSACTION SUMMARY:Leonardo DRS will acquire 100% of the share capital in RADA in exchange for approximately 19.5% equity ownership to RADA shareholders in the Combined Company, which will maintain the name Leonardo DRS and is anticipated to trade on NASDAQ and TASE under the symbol “DRS.”Post-closing, RADA will become a wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary of Leonardo DRS and operate as a business unit – including its U.S. subsidiaries – within DRS’s Advanced Sensing and Computing segment.The Board of Directors of each of RADA and Leonardo SpA approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 (subject to approval of the stockholders of RADA and other closing conditions including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals).Transaction is expected to be accretive to RADA earnings per share in year one.The 19.5% ownership in the combined company provided to RADA shareholders was designed to provide a premium in excess of 20% 3 ..

merger,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/09/14/blackboard-merge-anthology-creating-massive-ed-tech-company,"Blackboard to merge with Anthology, creating massive ed-tech company","Anthology, which emerged a year ago from the combination of three higher education administrative software firms, will merge with Blackboard, long the most visible company in learning technology, the two companies announced today. The deal will result in the end of Blackboard as a freestanding company, and could bring the end of its well-known, and sometimes controversial, brand.The companies did not share any financial data, but the combined entity is likely to be among the sectors biggest educational technology firms. Blackboards current owner, Providence Equity Partners, bought it in 2011 for $1.64 billion, and Blackboard was shopped (but not sold) in 2015 for about $3 billion.""Our combined footprint, from both a product perspective and from the more than 4,000 colleges and universities we serve worldwide, likely makes this the largest education technology company selling into higher education,"" Jim Milton, Anthologys chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview this morning. Milton will lead the combined company, whose name has not yet been decided.Anthology, whose roots date to 1988, emerged from the combination of Campus Management, a provider of administrative systems including student information, finance and human resources software; Campus Labs, a firm focused on assessment, learning and student success technology; and iModules, a community engagement software company. ListEdTech last year estimated that Anthology itself was the third-biggest higher ed administrative technology company behind Microsoft and Ellucian.Blackboard was for many years the dominant provider of learning management systems, though competitors such as Instructure (maker of Canvas) and D2L have gained ground and, in the formers case, surpassed it.In 2019, Blackboard sold off its Transact unit, one of the businesses it had bought as it sought to expand beyond being a learning management company. That led to intensifying speculation that the company could be broken up or sold, as it carried significant debt.Milton and Bill Ballhaus, Blackboards chairman, CEO and president, said the power of the combined company will flow from its ability to bring data from across the student life cycle to bear on student and institutional performance. ""Were on the cusp of breaking down the data siloes"" that often exist between administrative and academic departments on campuses, Ballhaus said.In the interview, a reporter asked Ballhaus whether Blackboard would disappear as a company and a brand. The company, while widely known, also has significant baggage from years as a target of faculty grumbling about its products and targeting by competitors.He said the new office that would manage the merger was just forming and would ""take a fresh look"" at many issues. ""Both brands bring a lot of assets and history to the table,"" he said. The most important thing is to see the combined entity realize its potential, and its important that we be unconstrained in our thinking about the best way to do that."""

The merger will bring together the two companies complementary asset bases including the Mulga Rock uranium project in Western Australia and the Tumas project in Namibia.Mulga Rock (Image: Vimy)According to the two companies, the merger will create a new global uranium player with ""significant scale"" and with cash resources of AUD106 million (about USD80 million). Its combined uranium resource inventory - some 389 million pounds U3O8 (14,963 tU) - will be one of the biggest in the world and will include two ""advanced, world class assets in Tier-1 uranium mining jurisdictions"".Under the scheme, Deep Yellow will acquire 100% of the Vimy shares on issue, while Vimy shareholders will receive 0.294 Deep Yellow shares for every Vimy share held. Deep Yellow shareholders will hold 53% of the merged group, and Vimy shareholders 47%.Deep Yellow has previously pursued a merger with Vimy: last November, it disclosed material details of a formal proposal it had made to the board of Vimy but which had then lapsed. Vimy subsequently announced the start of a strategic review process at Mulga Rock.The merged group will leverage Deep Yellows development, construction and operational expertise to ""unlock the development potential"" of the Mulga Rock project, they said. Combined with the future development of Tumas, it is expected to ""have the scale to rapidly advance its pipeline of organic growth opportunities"" and be well positioned to pursue additional accretive growth.Deep Yellow Managing Director and CEO John Borshoff said the merger has the potential to be a significant value-creating opportunity for the shareholders of both companies. ""The merger combines two world class assets, both in Tier-1 mining jurisdictions, into a single group with scale and know-how,"" he said. ""The expanded strong technical team of Deep Yellow, together with Vimy personnel, positions us well to bring both projects online when uranium prices support the generation of long-term, sustainable positive cash flows.""The merger de-risks and underpins the path to development at Mulga Rock, Vimy Managing Director and CEO Steven Michael said. ""The combined financial, processing and operating strengths of both companies will enable greater optimisation and the delivery of Mulga Rock, as well as an established exploration team that can unlock considerable value at Alligator River,"" he added, as well as ""expected significant benefits of being part of a larger, geographically diverse merged group, with the expertise to develop the full portfolio of assets in the near term.""Mulga Rock is 290km by road east-northeast of Kalgoorlie in the Great Victoria Desert of Western Australia. A Definitive Feasibility Study Refresh for the project released by Vimy in 2020 showed a strategic long-life uranium project with a contemplated production rate of 3.5 million pounds per year. The Government of Western Australias December 2016 approval of the project stipulated that Vimy must begin substantial commencement within five years, a condition which the company met when work on the excavation of a ramp at the Ambassador North pit began late last year.A Definitive Feasibility Study for Tumas is on track for completion by end of 2022, and Deep Yellow said it will work with Vimys technical team on elements of process that may be incorporated from Mulga Rock.The board of the merged group will be led by Borshoff and Deep Yellows Non-Executive Chairman Chris Salisbury. Michael will be an executive director. Subject to various court hearings and report preparations, the scheme of arrangement is expected to be implemented in July.Researched and written by World Nuclear NewsRelated topics"

The news of this transformational merger has shaken up both industries, raising eyebrows on Wall Street and drawing criticism from lawmakers and even the presidential campaigns.The deal is expected to face stringent scrutiny from regulators: the Department of Justice, which considers antitrust laws, and potentially also the Federal Communications Commission, which broadly weighs whether deals are in the public interest. (The FCCs involvement depends on whether the deal ends up involving broadcast licenses.)The companies underscore that their deal would combine two entities that dont directly compete in a so-called vertical merger. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier, one of the top broadband providers and — thanks to its recent purchase of DirecTV — also a major pay-TV provider. Time Warner (not to be confused with Time Warner Cable, which was recently bought by Charter Communications) is a massive media and entertainment conglomerate, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studio and other assets.A merger of two noncompeting companies — a content distributor and a content supplier — may not face a public interest test, says New Street Research analyst Vivek Stalam. ""So you dont necessarily need to prove that its absolutely good for the public interest, you just have to prove that its not bad.""But thats the top question on many consumers minds: What does this merger mean for me? Below are some of the proposed deals pros and cons.PROSThe promise of new kind of contentAT&T forecasts a new phase of video innovation — and argues that this deal will unleash it.CEO Randall Stephenson says the companys customers are demanding ""more and more premium content"" for their mobile devices — and they want it created, formatted and curated in a way specifically set up for mobility. ""As we begin to work with content creators to develop content for this world of mobility, its proving to be very difficult to get to a world of content thats really curated and formulated for the mobile experience,"" Stephenson tells NPRs David Folkenflik.The idea is that having one of the biggest content creators on your side would overcome hurdles in contract and rights negotiations, resulting in more experimentation with mobile video — or ""interactive programming"" touted by AT&Ts general counsel in a recent blog post — or whatever comes next.Potential competitor to cableAT&T also argues that one day, when the mobile networks reach super-fast 5G, the carriers nationwide reach combined with Time Warners success in content creation would offer an alternative to existing choices in cable and pay TV.Business AT&T-Time Warner Proposed Merger Is Compared To Comcast Deal AT&T-Time Warner Proposed Merger Is Compared To Comcast Deal Listen · 3:40 3:40""Youd have more packages.

""DirecTV, for instance, might favor Time Warner content, crowding out or refusing to carry alternative and independent programming that viewers might prefer,"" advocacy group Public Knowledge has argued, also positing that AT&T might try to toy with prices to drive customers to its platforms or exclude Time Warner content from data caps on its broadband networks.A related matter is the question of consumer privacy, with advocates raising questions about AT&Ts plans to safeguard consumer data as it pushes to track users across even more screens and platforms.Consolidation and risk of higher pricesThis is the antithesis to the idea that the colossal merger would create a competitor to cable and digital advertising giants, potentially lowering prices.Historically, consolidation does not tend to lower costs for consumers, partially because thats not something regulators typically can prescribe as they place conditions on deals.""The sorry history of megamergers shows they run roughshod over the public interest,"" says former FCC commissioner and now consumer interest advocate Michael Copps.

merger,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/visa-and-plaid-abandon-merger-after-antitrust-division-s-suit-block,Visa and Plaid Abandon Merger After Antitrust Division’s Suit to Block,"The Department of Justice announced today that Visa Inc. and Plaid Inc. have abandoned their planned $5.3 billion merger.The department filed a civil antitrust lawsuit on Nov. 5, 2020, to stop the merger, alleging that Visa is a monopolist in online debit, charging consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments. Plaid, a successful fintech firm, is developing a payments platform that would challenge Visa’s monopoly. According to the complaint, the transaction would have enabled Visa to eliminate this competitive threat to its online debit business before Plaid had a chance to succeed, thereby enhancing or maintaining its monopoly. The case was scheduled for trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on June 28, 2021. As a result of Visa and Plaid’s decision to terminate their merger agreement, the United States has filed a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal.“In a victory for American consumers and small businesses, Visa has abandoned its efforts to acquire an innovative and nascent competitor,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “American consumers and business owners rely on the internet to buy and sell goods and services, and Visa – which has immense power in online debit in the United States– has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions. Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visa’s online debit services. With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.”Assistant Attorney General Delrahim continued, “The department is grateful for the team of dedicated civil servants, lawyers and economists, who carefully reviewed this merger and pursued the litigation, ultimately building a case that the merger would extinguish a nascent competitor, further entrench Visa’s dominance in the online debit market, and harm consumers. Their diligent efforts to prosecute this case convinced the parties to abandon the deal rather than face us in court. We wish both companies well as they innovate and work to provide their products to American consumers.”Visa Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Foster City, California. Visa is a global payments company that operates the largest debit network in the United States. Visa’s 2019 revenues were approximately $23 billion.Plaid Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. Plaid is a financial services company that operates the leading financial data aggregation platform in the United States. In 2019, Plaid earned approximately $100 million in revenues."
merger,https://gamerant.com/ea-merger-plans-report/,EA is Reportedly Looking to Merge With Another Company,"The video game industry is in the middle of a gold rush of acquisitions. Microsoft, Sony, Embracer Group, and other companies are seeking new partners to acquire to help fill out their game release calenders. The reverse is also true, with companies exploring the possibility of being acquired, too. The latest example may come as a shock, however. A new report indicates Electronic Arts has been actively pursuing a sale or merger, and even came surprisingly close before the deal fell through.The report comes from outlet Puck, which claims that Electronic Arts is having conversations with some of the tech industrys largest companies regarding the possibility of a sale or merger. The list of potential partners includes Apple, Amazon, Comcast-NBCUniversal, and even Disney. As an explanation, the report says that Microsofts acquisition of Activision Blizzard ""emboldened"" the company to seek out possible partners to purchase it.RELATED: EA Lists Major Unannounced IP to Launch in 2023While details regarding most talks were left unsaid, the report does explain that a deal did move forward with Comcast-NBCUniversal at one point. The deal would have involved Comcast-NBCUniversal spinning off the NBCUniversal media portion of the company to merge with Electronic Arts. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts family would take majority control of the new company, while EA CEO Andrew Wilson would stay on to run the company. The deal is said to have fallen through relatively recently over price and corporate structure post-merger.A merger between Electronic Arts and another company is said to be its preference over an outright acquisition. Its also said that EA is trying to ensure that Wilson is retained as the companys CEO following the merger. Those expectations could explain why a deal hasnt gone through at this point.Electronic Arts isnt the only company thats pursuing a different option than being directly acquired, of course. Ubisofts CEO Yves Guillemot is reportedly trying to work with private equity firms in order to retain control of the company. Its said to be facing possible acquisition efforts from other private equity firms. It just goes to show that while the market may be conducive to good deals, not all deals are equal.While the report doesnt clarify, it can likely be assumed that Electronic Arts will continue to explore the possibility of being acquired or merging with another company going forward. As strange as it may seem that EA could be acquired, few could have foreseen Microsoft picking up Activision Blizzard, too. Expect further reports on EAs plans going forward.MORE: The Pros and Cons of the EA Sports-FIFA SplitSource: Puck"
merger,https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2021/12/03/prc-commissioners-have-concerns-over-avangrid-pnm-merger-as-companies-defend/,"PRC commissioners have concerns over Avangrid/PNM merger, as companies defend","Officials from Public Service Company of New Mexico and Avangrid say a pending merger would help the state’s largest electric utility reach renewable energy targets at a faster pace.The two companies hosted a press conference on Thursday following the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission’s discussion the previous day regarding a hearing examiner’s recommendation that the commission deny the merger.Three of the five commissioners stated during the Wednesday meeting that they oppose the merger and believe that the potential harms to the customers outweigh the benefits.Commission Chairman Stephen Fischmann, who was the first commissioner to express opposition to the merger, said that the main reason to reject it is that Avangrid has an “absolutely horrible record of running U.S. utilities.”Commissioners Cynthia Hall and Theresa Becenti-Aguilar joined Fischmann in voicing opposition, which is an unusual move for the PRC, as the merger was not scheduled for a vote and the commission must still hear the exceptions in the case presented.Related: Hearing examiner says potential harms outweigh benefits in PNM/Avangrid mergerDuring the Thursday press conference, Attorney General Hector Balderas criticized the commissioners for voicing their opposition prior to the official vote and prior to hearing all the evidence.“Based on the commissioners’ statements yesterday, I am a little concerned that they seem to have implied as jurors that they’re leaning one way or another in terms of making their decision,” he said.During Thursday’s press conference, Balderas also spoke about the importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels and said that the merger could help New Mexico achieve the goals set out in the 2019 Energy Transition Act.Even if the merger is rejected, Vincent-Collawn said PNM remains committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels, as required by the Energy Transition Act, though it will take a bit longer.This comes as Avangrid has faced opposition in Maine where customers and state officials say reliability has decreased and rates have increased following Avangrid’s acquisition of Central Maine Power. It also comes amid an investigation in Spain involving Avangrid’s parent company, Iberdrola, and corporate espionage. Avangrid has also faced more than $60 million in fines from New England regulators in multiple states for service issues.Related: Iberdrola executives named in criminal espionage investigationPNM and Avangrid officials used the press conference to address some of these concerns–saying that Avangrid’s utilities in the northeast have performed better than average and that New Mexico does not have the same weather conditions or dense vegetation that has led to problems in places like Maine. Pedro Azagra Blázquez, Iberdrola’s corporate development director, also said that the investigation in Spain is ongoing and that it has not yet yielded any indictments or charges or determinations of wrongdoing. The officials also said that, if the merger is approved, the company would be required to pay fines if it did not meet reliability requirements and that any rate increase would require PRC approval.While the hearing examiner has recommended the commission vote to reject the merger, he provided a list of recommended conditions for the commission to include should it choose to approve the merger.“It’s important that we listen closely to the hearing examiner because he also gave the commission a path forward to bring accountability to this field and also secure public interest in this clean energy economy race that we’re in,” Balderas said.PNM Resources Chairwoman, President and CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said the companies agree to those conditions.She said the merger of the two companies provides a better credit rating for PNM as it looks to develop electric vehicle charging networks and to transition away from fossil fuels.PNM could also benefit from Avangrid’s large size, which will make it easier to acquire equipment at lower costs. Later she compared it to shopping at Costco and said if you buy in bulk you are able to save money.Azagra Blázquez said the merger also moves $1 billion of PNM’s debt out of New Mexico and will provide opportunities for economic development in the state. Should the merger be rejected, he said Avangrid and Iberdrola would not consider New Mexico as a place to locate certain resources and activities. For example, he highlighted a command center for off-shore wind. If the merger is approved, on the other hand, he said Avangrid would base operations out of New Mexico on a national scale.He also said that Avangrid would help New Mexico develop a hydrogen industry. Iberdrola announced this week a partnership with a startup steel company in Sweden to build a renewable hydrogen plant in either Spain or Portugal that would power the iron production that is needed to make steel. This project’s budget is about $2.6 billion.Projects that aren’t specifically tied to utilities are among the concerns that the hearing examiner highlighted in his recommended decision. He said Moody’s, a credit rating agency, downgraded Avangrid’s score due to Avangrid Renewables’ investments in non-utility projects.Ashley Schannauer, the hearing examiner, said Avangrid has an interest in expanding its renewables business in the southwest and this may not be consistent with providing reliable utility services to PNM customers.“Avangrid states that it wants to use its acquisition of PNM as a beachhead for Avangrid Renewables’ projects in New Mexico and the Southwest. The resource needs of Avangrid Renewables may take priority over PNM needs for resources to provide reliable utility service to its customers,” he said.Schannauer also said the merger could result in rigged bidding processes and that PNM would favor using Avangrid-owned renewable resources over those developed by other companies, thus increasing the electricity costs that customers would pay.The vast majority of public input has urged the PRC to reject the merger. Commissioner Cynthia Hall said she has received hundreds of communications with members of the public opposing the merger.At the start of the PRC meeting, many of the public commenters, including people from Maine who are current Avangrid customers, asked the commissioners to reject the merger.Daniel Pritchard, a Taos resident who is on the board of directors for Renewable Taos, said the merger is a takeover by a foreign company “that continues the treatment of New Mexico as a sacrifice zone where our energy resources get mined and sold and the profits leave the state.”He said if the merger takes place profits will go to a Spanish corporation.“This is absolutely the wrong way to support economic development for New Mexico. It would be best if these profits stayed within New Mexico,” he said.Jim DesJardins, the executive director of Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico, said there have been complaints that Central Maine Power under Avangrid improperly increased the costs that renewable energy developers had to pay to connect to the grid. He also expressed concerns about Central Maine Power’s net metering policies. Net metering allows customers who have solar panels at their house or business to sell excess power produced back to the company. Central Maine Power and Avangrid pushed for phasing out net metering requirements.“Our organization has not taken a position either way on the merger,” DesJardins said. “We do urge that if the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approves the merger, that there’ll be a commitment from the merged companies that net metering is preserved in a fair treatment for small generators in New Mexico. And we believe that this will help to provide the optimal grid for safety, reliability and clean energy.”The merger has support from various union groups that would benefit from the proposed conditions, including increased jobs for New Mexicans in the utility sphere. It also has support from economic development groups like the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce.Despite the fact that three commissioners have voiced opposition to the merger, Vincent-Collawn said PNM trusts the regulatory process.Schannauer acknowledged that the benefits proposed in the merger stipulation–including investments in economic development, job creation and assistance for low-income customers–are greater than those seen in other merger cases that the PRC has granted. However, he said those previous cases did not have the potential harms to customers that the Avangrid and PNM merger case has.“The benefits are not meaningful if PNM customers do not have reliable service,” he said."

merger,https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/12/14/media-mergers/,Why publishers like Vox Media are merging with their biggest rivals,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareThere was a time when the biggest companies in digital media seemed to be on the verge of selling for billions of dollars. Vice Media, co-founded by the eccentric showman Shane Smith, was valued at $5.7 billion back in 2017. BuzzFeed and Vox Media were both valued at $1 billion or more six years ago, based on investments of about $200 million each from NBCUniversal, the parent company of MSNBC and NBC News.But, those huge values have so far proved largely theoretical. With the exception of German media conglomerate Axel Springer’s decision to pay about $1 billion this past summer to buy Politico, few buyers were willing to actually pony up the money to buy the hottest brands in digital media. Vice Media’s valuation has also ticked down substantially, as companies have struggled to achieve sizable profit margins. “The luster came off,” said Brandon Ross, a media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners.In the absence of well-heeled suitors, some of the most influential and successful companies in the digital media industry have instead pivoted to a strategy of consolidation, buying up and merging with onetime competitors. With a larger total audience, those companies can make more money from corporate advertisers and are better positioned to compete with tech giants such as Facebook and Google — or so the thinking goes.AdvertisementMonday night provided a vivid example of such strategic collaboration, with the D.C.-based Vox Media announcing plans to acquire and merge with the New York City-based Group Nine Media, one of the largest media transactions in recent memory.The deal was made in exchange for stock in the combined company, not cash, said Vox Media chief executive and co-founder Jim Bankoff, who will run the expanded entity. “The acquisition of Group Nine will contribute to making us an even stronger company collectively, and that is what we and our board of directors determined is the best path forward for all of our stakeholders,” he said in an interview.Specifically, Bankoff said the deal will provide more financial resources for the company to invest in editorial products such as the general interest news site Vox.com, tech news site The Verge, sports news site SB Nation, and now the media websites that make up Group Nine Media, including travel lifestyle brand Thrillist, news-focused site NowThis and the Dodo, which publishes cute and educational content about animals.Advertisement“I have zero question that it’s the right decision,” Group Nine Media chief executive Ben Lerer told The Washington Post. “I think this marries two things that are really working, while a lot of the dealmaking … around digital media is trying to solve a problem by putting things together. This not about that. This is about growth.” (Lerer will serve on the board of the expanded Vox Media and will be “really available for anything and everything” that company leadership needs, he said).Asked why Group Nine Media chose a merger rather than a sale to a larger company, Lerer said he looked around and chose the best long-term option. “This really wasn’t about going to sell the company,” he added. “We weren’t running a sale process and Vox made the best bid. This was about finding a partner that made sense” and shared a similar vision for how to achieve future success.Both companies had already grown through acquisition. Vox Media purchased New York magazine and its digital properties in 2019. In April of this year, the company acquired a podcast-focused company called Cafe Studios that was co-founded by Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Group Nine Media, which was formed in 2016 with substantial funding from Discovery Communications, acquired PopSugar in 2019.AdvertisementBuzzFeed is embracing a similar strategy of consolidation, but has done so in a different way, choosing to begin selling stock on the public market through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (also known as a “blank check company”) that will provide money for the company to make more investments. As part of that process, the company recently acquired youth entertainment company Complex Networks for $200 million, plus $100 million in company stock. BuzzFeed had already grown bigger by acquiring the HuffPost website in November 2020, which has changed hands multiple times since it was first sold to AOL in 2011.When it began trading on Nasdaq at the beginning of last week, BuzzFeed said it became the first publicly traded digital media company. The stock began selling at a price of $10.95 per share, but ended trading on Monday at $6.25, a 43 percent decline. The company says that it is too early to draw any major conclusions from just over one week of trading — either about BuzzFeed’s value or about the broader strength of the digital media industry. “We’ll focus on the long term and not stress about the daily fluctuations of our stock price,” chief executive Jonah Peretti assured employees last week.Vice Media, which acquired the women-focused lifestyle brand Refinery29 in 2019, has not gone public and has not made any further major transactions but has continued to raise gobs of money from investors. The company raised $135 million more this past fall, including additional investment from longtime backer James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch. Company chief executive Nancy Dubuc, who replaced Smith at the helm in 2018, said in September that the company is “in a stronger position today than ever before.”AdvertisementJim VandeHei, a former Washington Post reporter who co-founded Politico and then co-founded Axios, which he now runs, said that consolidation “makes a lot of sense for older, bigger companies in search of size or their next act.” But he left Axios off that list. “We thought about consolidation and decided it’s easier in this environment to grow on our own,” he said, citing positive trends in the advertising and subscription business. (Axios reportedly held talks with Axel Springer about a possible sale earlier in the year.)For now, Vox Media is focused on completing its merger with Group Nine, a deal that is expected to close in the first few months of 2022. But Bankoff has not ruled out going public — like BuzzFeed — in the future. “We’re always going to do what’s in the best interest of our stakeholders, our employees, our audience, our investors,” he said. “Remaining independent — operating from a position of creative strength, financial strength and cultural strength — is and has been our priority.”Media consolidation deals might make sense for company management and investors, but mergers often lead to employee layoffs. Vox Media’s chief executive indirectly referenced that possibility when he wrote about integrating functions at the two companies in an email sent to employees on Monday afternoon.But, he assured employees that the company “will be thoughtful” in making those decisions down the road.GiftOutline Gift Article"

Sues Penguin Random House Over Simon & Schuster Deal,"In response to the Justice Department’s decision, Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster issued a joint statement noting that Penguin Random House had not planned “any reduction in the number of books acquired or in amounts paid for those acquisitions.” The rationale for bringing the companies together, they said, was to find efficiencies that would save money on the back end, and that it had no plans to reduce the number of books it acquires or the amounts it pays for them.“The government should only be challenging those mergers where they can prove that, as a result of the combination, consumers are going to be harmed — typically in the form of higher prices. And here there is no such evidence,” Mr. Petrocelli said in a phone interview.“The government does allege that consumers will have fewer books, but that is completely speculative through a chain of strained logic. They’re not going to be able to prove that at the end of the day,” he added.The department’s focus on the advances paid to authors — rather than what a consumer pays for a book — signals a significant shift. For decades, courts have largely judged mergers on whether or not they will result in higher prices for customers. But a growing cadre of lawmakers, activists and academics say that focus is too narrow. Instead, they say prosecutors should consider harms to competitors, workers and suppliers.Many of the most sought-after books sell at auction, with multiple publishing houses bidding against one another. But some publishers don’t allow different imprints within the same company to compete at an auction."

Douglas Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University and former acting chief of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division.The F.T.C. and the Justice Department are likely to look for ways to have an impact without being subject to judicial review, Mr. Melamed said, and one way to do that is by challenging mergers in general, whether or not a case has a good chance of winning.“The risk and time delays of a merger challenge often cause the parties to abandon a deal even if the government’s case is weak,” he said."

Within governments and across the broader economy, Planet’s daily information feeds are helping to define new methods to monitor resources and account for environmental assets, which is foundational for the ESG transition to enabling a sustainable economy.Planet’s data is optimized for machine learning and delivered via a cloud-native platform, transforming the way companies and governments leverage satellite data and derived products, and delivering insights on a daily basis. This powerful dataset is collected by a fleet of about 200 satellites–the largest Earth observation satellite fleet ever–which Planet designs, builds, and operates in house. This constellation captures over 3 million images per day, covering over 300 million square kilometers and generating approximately 25 terabytes of data per day.With this data captured and archived every day, Planet has an extensive catalogue of high-resolution Earth images – over 1,500 on average for every point on the Earth’s land mass – providing the ability to go back through time and analyze historical change as well as fuel powerful machine learning applications.Planet’s business is enabled by “agile aerospace,” a concept for which the Company was a pioneer. This approach leads to rapidly iterating capabilities in orbit for improved solutions for customers, while dramatically lowering costs compared to traditional aerospace companies. Planet’s vertical integration of satellite design, manufacturing, and operation allows it to cost-effectively develop new data layers and quickly address emerging market requirements relative to other satellite Earth data providers. As new data sets are added, Planet’s products and services enable customers to solve more complex challenges.Transaction OverviewThe transaction values Planet at a post-transaction equity value of approximately $2.8 billion. Existing Planet stockholders will retain 77% ownership in the pro forma company and may receive up to an additional 27 million new Planet shares, depending on the performance of the share price during the five year period following the closing.Concurrently with the consummation of the transaction, additional investors have committed to participate in the proposed business combination by purchasing shares of Class A common stock of dMY IV in a private placement (the “PIPE”). The $200 million PIPE investment is led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, with participation from Koch Strategic Platforms, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, and Google. After paying transaction expenses and paydown of Planet’s existing debt, the balance of the $345 million in cash held in dMY IV’s trust account (assuming no redemptions), together with the approximately $200 million in PIPE proceeds, will be used to fund operations and support new and existing growth initiatives.The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by dMY IV’s Board of Directors and Planet’s Board of Directors, is expected to close later this year, subject to approval by dMY IV’s and Planet’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.Management & GovernancePlanet’s management team, led by CEO, Co-Founder and Chair Will Marshall and Chief Strategy Officer, Co-Founder and Director, Robbie Schingler, CFO/COO Ashley Johnson and President, Product and Business Strategy, Kevin Weil, will continue to lead the public company following the transaction.

merger,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/health/cigna-express-scripts-merger.html,Merger of Cigna and Express Scripts Gets Approval From Justice Dept.,"Both companies argue that the merger will benefit consumers by allowing Cigna and Express Scripts to better manage their customers’ health by sharing information about both their medical and drug expenses. The other major insurers, UnitedHealth Group and Anthem, have also moved away from using outside benefit managers, posing major threats to CVS and Express Scripts.“Together, we believe we will be able to do even more to reduce health care costs, expand choice, and improve patient outcomes,” Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, said in a statement.Rising drug prices are forcing the issue for the insurers, said Terry Stone, a managing partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant. Many were unprepared for the onslaught of new, very expensive medications, she said, and were “caught off guard” when the new hepatitis C drugs were introduced a few years ago at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars to treat a single individual.She argued the combination of these large insurers, with expertise in managing costs for chronic diseases, and the pharmacy managers offer “a huge amount of synergy.”Both the insurers and pharmacy companies are under tremendous pressure to prove they can deliver cost-conscious results, said Jim Winkler, a senior executive at Aon, a benefits consultant. “It is reasonable to say both models have to change and will change,” he said."

Food Lion is a subsidiary of Belgian’s Delhaize Group.Royal Ahold, also known as Ahold, made reference in a news release to the business combination being confirmed by both parties on May 12.“Ahold and Delhaize Group would like to stress that while they are in the final stages of negotiations, no definitive agreement on a transaction has been reached. Ahold expects to issue a press release in due course,” the statement said.The Wall Street Journal reported the two grocers sold a combined $46 billion in goods last year, representing 4.6 percent of the U.S. market. It placed the merger at nearly $26 billion based on share prices.There are three Martins stores in Hagerstown, three in Franklin County, Pa., and several in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia and Frederick, Md.There are more than a dozen Food Lion stores in Washington County, Md., Franklin County, Pa., and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.“I think it would create a major grocery store chain. They both have a significant presence with stores and distribution in central Pennsylvania,” said L. Michael Ross, president of the Franklin County (Pa.) Area Development Corp.Food Lion also owns and operates a distribution center in the Greencastle, Pa., area, he said.Ross said he could not speculate on how the operations, store names and distribution network would be affected by such a merger.Media reports indicate the Tri-State area would be one of the few geographical areas where the two companies’ 2,000 stores overlap in the same markets."

merger,https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820435/lucid-motors-sec-investigation-spac-merger-churchill,Lucid Motors’ mega SPAC merger is under investigation,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating yet another merger between an EV startup and a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. This time, it’s the massive deal from July that turned Saudi-owned Lucid Motors into a publicly traded company worth more than $20 billion.Lucid Motors announced the probe in a Monday morning stock exchange filing. The startup said that it received a subpoena from the SEC on December 3rd “requesting the production of certain documents related to an investigation” that “appears to concern” the merger, as well as “certain projections and statements.” Lucid Motors said it’s “cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.”What’s a SPAC? A SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company — basically, a pile of cash reserved for a merger that went through the initial public offering (IPO) process. The entire point of the SPAC is to find a private company to merge with. When that happens, the target company essentially goes public without some of the hassles of the traditional IPO process. There has been a lot more SPAC action than usual lately; The Wall Street Journal even declared 2020 a record year for SPACs. Companies such as Virgin Atlantic, Opendoor, Lordstown Motors, and Fisker have all gone through the process. For a more detailed explanation of how SPACS differ from IPOs, see our SPAC explainer.The startup, which was founded in 2007 as a battery tech company and rescued by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018, announced in February that it was merging with a SPAC run by investor Michael Klein called Churchill Capital IV. Lucid Motors ultimately raised more than $4 billion in the deal and started shipping its first electric vehicle — the Air sedan — in October. The startup’s valuation had soared since, and it recently passed the market cap of legacy automakers like Ford. But Monday’s news sent Lucid Motors’ stock tumbling.The SEC is already investigating the SPAC mergers that turned Lordstown Motors, Canoo, and Nikola into publicly traded electric vehicle startups. The agency has been particularly focused on the validity of the financial projections these companies made when they announced the mergers, as well as any claims they made about the preorders collected for their vehicles.Nikola’s founder was indicted earlier this year on charges brought by the SEC (as well as parallel charges from the Department of Justice), and the company recently said it has set aside $125 million for an expected settlement with the agency. Lordstown Motors’ CEO resigned after the company’s own investigation found he had made misleading claims about preorders for its electric pickup truck, though the SEC and DOJ are still probing the startup. Canoo said as recently as November that it continues to cooperate with the SEC in its own investigation."

Eric Piermont/AFP via Getty ImagesKEY FACTSShares of both companies rallied on the news, with Accor rising over 3% and InterContinental by nearly 2%. A merger would mean Marriott would no longer be the largest hotel company in the world—InterContinental and Accor would have 1.6 million rooms, Reuters reports, compared with Marriott’s 1.3 million. Based on current market prices, a combined firm would have a market value of about $17 billion, merging Accor’s 5,000 properties—including Raffles, Sofitel and Ibis—with InterContinental’s almost 6,000 hotels, which includes brands like Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza. Although Accor has not made any formal approach, its management board is apparently in favor of a deal, Le Figaro reported, without naming sources. But Accor chairman and CEO Sebastien Bazin—who set up an internal task force in June to examine a potential merger—is cautious about moving forward and Accor is yet to contact InterContinental, the French daily newspaper said. An Accor spokesperson told Reuters that the company doesn’t comment on market rumors, while InterContinental has yet to respond to the news.Key backgroundShares of both companies have been hard hit as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the global travel industry, forcing many hotel operators to temporarily halt bookings, make jobs cuts and shore up their finances. Accor’s stock has slumped more than 40% in overseas trading so far this year, while InterContinental, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, is down over 23%. What’s more, Accor was recently downgraded to junk status by S&P Global earlier this week, meaning that the company now faces higher interest payments.What to watch forA merger could make geographical sense for the two companies, since Accor’s family of brands is more skewed toward Europe but InterContinental has larger operations in the U.S. and is a growing presence in China, according to Reuters. It would also offer substantial cost savings, such as on headquarters expenses, reservation systems and loyalty programs, Le Figaro’s report said.Chief criticsA combination of the two companies would still be an immensely complex deal based on the sheer size of their operations, Bernstein analysts said in a recent note. What’s more, a deal would have made more sense when shares of InterContinental bottomed out earlier this year, but now has less merit given the stock’s rebound, the analysts wrote. Accor would be better off concentrating on the “near-free growth” that comes from striking deals with hotel owners to rebrand existing properties, they said. “This will not help the investor perception that Accor management will not stick to its organic growth/simplification strategy and will continue to look for big deals.”"

merger,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/business/aon-willis-towers-watson-merger.html,Two insurance giants call off their planned merger after a Justice Dept. lawsuit.,"The government’s complaint argued that the combined companies would “eliminate substantial head-to-head competition and likely lead to higher prices and less innovation.” It said the companies dominated markets for risk and reinsurance brokering, health and pension benefits brokering, actuarial services for employer benefit programs and private exchanges that offer retiree benefits.The government said previously that the companies were aware they already operated in an oligopoly. “If permitted to merge, Aon and Willis Towers Watson could use their increased leverage to raise prices and reduce the quality of products relied on by thousands of American businesses — and their customers, employees and retirees,” the Department of Justice wrote last month.Aon argued that the government misunderstood its businesses. “We are confident that the combination would have accelerated our shared ability to innovate on behalf of clients, but the inability to secure an expedited resolution of the litigation brought us to this point,” Mr. Case said in the statement.The decision to abandon the deal “highlights one of the possible implications of more aggressive enforcement” as Mr. Biden makes good on campaign promises to be tough on companies, said A. Douglas Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University and former acting chief of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division.The F.T.C. and the Justice Department are likely to look for ways to have an impact without being subject to judicial review, Mr. Melamed said, and one way to do that is by challenging mergers in general, whether or not a case has a good chance of winning.“The risk and time delays of a merger challenge often cause the parties to abandon a deal even if the government’s case is weak,” he said."

The deal marks the end of an era for the iconic DVR company.The original TiVo company was bought back in 2016 by Rovi for $1.1 billion, primarily for TiVo’s huge (and profitable) stash of patents. Rovi would go on to change its name to TiVo post-acquisition, and the combined company, which still makes most of its money through patent licensing, is now merging with California-based Xperi.The Rovi-owned TiVo had previously been exploring a split into two separate companies earlier this year, dividing the once-popular product department from the less consumer-facing but lucrative patent licensing half. That plan has been scrapped, though, due to the Xperi merger.TiVo is best known for its pioneering DVR set-top boxes, which the company still produces today, albeit with far less popularity than it once commanded in the marketplace. But the bulk of the company’s revenue (both before and after the Rovi acquisition) has come from licensing its portfolio of patents to other vendors.This is all about IP licensing not DVR hardware; Rovi (TV guide/metadata company) bought TiVo in 2016. But it’s going to make my CES briefings a lot more interesting. https://t.co/Y7WAtjXEFJ — Avi Greengart (@greengart) December 19, 2019According to market analyst Avi Greengart, as with the 2016 Rovi purchase, the new deal is focused on IP licensing, not TiVo’s DVR hardware, although the newly merged company (which will go by the name Xperi) still reportedly plans to offer products under the TiVo name in the future. It’s a similar arrangement to that of audio technology brand DTS, which Xperi acquired back in 2016.As Xperi’s press release announcing the merger proudly boasts, “With 10,000 patents and applications between the two companies and minimal licensee overlap, the combined IP business will be one of the largest licensing companies in the world.”"

The new company will be called ViacomCBS Inc., in a nod to the legacy of Sumner Redstone, the ailing 96-year-old media titan who built an empire from a small chain of drive-in movie theaters in the Northeast.Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish will become president and chief executive of the new entity, and gain a seat on the board. Shari Redstone, the mogul’s daughter, will become the first chairwoman in Viacom’s history.The proposed merger of the two New York-based companies is the latest in the wave of entertainment industry consolidations and was widely expected. It was the third time in three years that CBS and Viacom attempted to hook up.Last year, telecommunications colossus AT&T bought HBO, CNN, TBS and the Warner Bros. studio in an $85-billion deal. In March, Walt Disney Co. completed a $71.3-billion acquisition of much of Rupert Murdoch’s Hollywood holdings.AdvertisementCBS and Viacom suddenly found themselves medium-sized players, no longer leaders of the industry. But it wasn’t just a consolidating industry and splintering audiences that drove the two companies together. Both were weakened by years of internal turmoil: boardroom battles, costly lawsuits, financial miscalculations and management woes.ViacomCBS will be worth about $30 billion.Investors responded favorably to the news. Viacom shares closed at $29.21, up 2.4% while CBS shares rose 1.3% to $48.70.The Redstone family, through its Massachusetts-based investment vehicle, National Amusements Inc., controls nearly 80% of the voting shares of the two companies. The family firm already has approved the all-stock transaction. Existing CBS shareholders will own 61% of the combined company, while existing Viacom shareholders will own about 39%. Viacom shareholders will receive .59625 shares of CBS stock for every Viacom share that they own. On Tuesday, Wall Street valued Viacom at about $12 billion.The new company will be one of the largest players in TV advertising, capturing an estimated 22% of viewership to traditional television. That will be in the same league as Comcast Corp., which owns NBCUniversal, and ahead of Walt Disney Co. Combined, the company spends more than $13 billion a year to produce content. It will have a growing presence in the streaming space and access to a library stocked with more than 140,000 television episodes and more than 3,600 movie titles.The company also will have international exposure with networks in Britain, Australia and Argentina. CBS’ premium channel, Showtime, will have access to movies from Paramount Pictures’ deep library, which includes such properties as “The Godfather,” “Top Gun” and “Transformers.”“Even though Viacom and CBS will be a larger company, it will still have to compete with Disney, which is in a league of its own,” said Jordan Matthews, an entertainment lawyer with Weinberg Gonser in Los Angeles.The merger, which was ratified overwhelmingly by the boards of both companies, requires the approval of government regulators, a process that is expected to take several months. The companies said they expect the deal to be complete by year’s end.The corporate combination, expected to achieve $500 million in savings, will be a homecoming of sorts. The two companies have had a long and often turbulent history. CBS created what would become Viacom in 1952 as a vehicle to sell into syndication such popular shows as “I Love Lucy.” Regulatory rules forced CBS to divest the unit in 1971.More than a quarter-century later, then-Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone victoriously announced what he called “a merger of equals” between his company and CBS. In a September 1999 news conference, Redstone told journalists: “Viacom and CBS are natural partners ... we are siblings.” At that time, Wall Street valued a combined Viacom-CBS at $80 billion.The marriage lasted just six years. In 2006, Redstone divided his empire, saying the two halves could stand on their own.The billionaire from Boston was convinced the future was brighter for his Viacom, which owned cable TV channels and Paramount. Viacom was a darling on Wall Street and Madison Avenue because its networks — Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV — drew younger viewers who were prized by advertisers. The breakup benefited Redstone, too, because he became controlling shareholder and executive chairman of two companies.Time proved Redstone wrong.“We have long believed that the initial separation of these companies made zero sense,” media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a recent report.In the last several years, audience behavior changed drastically. Younger viewers were the first to flee traditional TV. Now, teenagers and young adults spend more time playing video games, watching video clips on their phones or shows from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu than MTV. Amid the migration, Viacom made a series of management blunders, including awarding its top executives hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation while under-investing in programming. Viacom’s brass sold its valuable Nickelodeon shows to Netflix, helping the Los Gatos, Calif., company build its audience.Paramount also struggled under the leadership of the late Brad Grey, weathering a period of flops and enormous losses.“The studio suffered over $1 billion in losses,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.Viacom lost more than half its value. Five years ago, its stock traded for more than $75 a share. Viacom closed Friday at $30.01 a share.Shari Redstone led a management shakeup at Viacom in 2016 that ousted her father’s longtime allies. She installed Bakish as chief executive of Viacom.Since then, the 55-year-old executive has worked to improve Viacom’s corporate culture, invest in programming and make small acquisitions, including streaming service Pluto TV, to broaden Viacom’s reach. Bakish overhauled the management of the moribund Paramount film studio and tossed out senior management at the TV channels. In its most recent fiscal quarter, Viacom hit a milestone when it reported that domestic advertising revenue had increased for the first time in five years. The company also boasts this summer’s top cable series, “Yellowstone.”“Shari and Bob saved Viacom,” said Sonnenfeld. “Bob is not a back-slapping cheerleader. He might be an anomaly in show business, which is filled with self-promoters, but he is a classic example of still waters run deep.”Shari Redstone, pressed for a Viacom-CBS merger in 2016, and again last year.She was rebuffed the first time because CBS’ management, including its former powerful chief executive, Leslie Moonves, and independent board members worried that the battered Viacom would be a drag on CBS. Then, last year, merger talks collapsed when CBS’ independent board members sued the Redstones in an unsuccessful attempt to strip the family of its controlling votes.Amid the high-stakes legal fight, CBS became engulfed in a scandal. A dozen women accused Moonves of sexual harassment or assault. He denied the allegations but was forced to resign in September.Since then, CBS has lost more than 10% of its value. The controversy led to changes in the CBS board, the appointment of Joseph Ianniello as the acting CEO, and, ultimately, the merger talks that began earlier this year and culminated this week.Ianniello, 51, will remain in charge of the CBS properties, which include the broadcast network, production studios, a chain of television stations, the streaming service CBS All Access, CBS Films, Showtime Networks and the Simon & Schuster book publishing house. His new title will be chairman and chief executive of CBS.Over the last decade, CBS has worked to adapt to the changes, while maintaining its status as the most-watched TV network in America with such popular shows as “NCIS,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “60 Minutes.” On the business side, the company shed mature assets, including its billboard division and radio stations. It was among the first to stream live programming. It invested to build CBS Television Studios and Showtime. CBS Television Studios now is one of the largest in Hollywood, producing 89 shows, up from 70 a year ago.The new board will consist of 13 members, including six independent members from CBS, four independent members from Viacom, Bakish and two designees of National Amusements, including Shari Redstone.But the challenges are steep, and Viacom has more than $8.5 billion in debt that must be absorbed.Viacom-CBS still will continue to be a relative small fry — unless it combines with other independent studios, such as Sony Pictures Entertainment or a major telecommunications company like Verizon or T-Mobile.Disney’s market valuation is nearly $250 billion, slightly less than AT&T’s. Comcast, which also owns the European television service Sky, is approaching $200 billion. Netflix is valued at $140 billion.“It’s a very disruptive time in the industry,” Daniel A. Lyons, professor at Boston College Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. “This consolidation is either about leveraging as many assets as you can to build CBS All Access into a streaming service like Disney+, or by packaging enough channels and library content together so that you can flip the company.”"

merger,https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-881_en.htm,"UPDATED: NextEra, Hawaiian Electric terminate merger after PUC rejection","Dive Brief:NextEra Energy and Hawaiian Electric terminated their plans to merge following rejection of an aquisition application by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) last week, the companies announced July 18.In a 2-0 vote, the PUC rejected NextEra Energys proposed $4.3 billion takeover of Hawaiian Electric Industries in an order issued on Friday, saying the merger was not in the public interest and that the companies failed to demonstrate adequate benefits for residents and a commitment to Hawaiis clean energy goals, among other concerns.The ruling leaves the door open for future merger applications, saying it it does not mean that the commission is ruling out a change in control of the Hawaiian Electric companies. Regulators also outlined stipulations for any future merger or acquisition proposal.​Dive Insight:Hawaii PUCs decision to reject the HEI-NextEra merger may not surprise longtime observers of the merger proceeding, given the widespread opposition to the deal in Hawaii. But nearly two years after the merger was first proposed in December 2014, the rejection represents a turning point for both companies.The PUCs decision comes amid turmoil at the regulatory body over the recent appointment of a new commissioner to replace Michael Champley. At the end of last month, Gov. David Ige (D) named Thomas Gorak, chief counsel to the Hawaii PUC, to replace Champley, whose term ended on June 30. Gorak abstained from voting, but said he supported the decision.A recent anonymous report questioned Goraks tenure as chief counsel and revealed details about regulatory infighting on the NextEra-HECO decision and other dockets. While PUC Chair dismissed the complaint as a ""smear,"" Iges decision to replace Champley, a supporter of the NextEra-HECO merger, may have tilted the commissions balance just as it was preparing to issue a decision.While Ige previously said he was unaware of the PUC deliberations, he has been a staunch critic of the deal.From the beginning, NextEra struggled to win support for its merger plan.Many intervenors worried the mergers approval would raise electricity rates in the state, already the highest in the nation. Concerns over NextEras track record with renewables at its regulated utility Florida Light & Power caused some stakeholders to argue that the merger would not help Hawaii meet its 100%-renewables-by-2045 mandate.NextEra promised lower rates after the merger, but most Hawaii residents believed the opposite would be true if the deal went through, according to a February poll by Honolulu Civil Beat. Those polled were split on whether the deal would impede Hawaii’s move to 100% renewables by 2045, with 39% saying it would slow down progress and 35% expecting renewables growth to be unaffected.Intervenors were even more skeptical of the deal. Of the dozens of parties involved in the proceeding, only the local electrical workers union and the Hawaii Department of Defense supported the deal.In the immediate aftermath of the decision, it was unclear how the companies planned to proceed. In other utility mergers, like the Exelon-Pepco deal in Washington, companies have won approval from regulators once making changes to their acquistion applications.But that wont happen in Hawaii. NextEra and Hawaiian Electric announced their termination of the deal Monday morning, saying NextEra will pay a $90 million break-up fee and up to $5 million for reimbursement of expenses associated with the transaction.The PUC left the door open to future merger applications, outlining the conditions upon which the deal could be approved. A statement from the governors office also suggested the possibility of a future merger.""This ruling gives us a chance to reset and refocus on our goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2045. The proceeding helped define the characteristics and parameters of Hawaii’s preferred energy future. We look forward to creating a process to find the best partner in the world,"" Ige said. ""No matter who owns the company, the energy vision for Hawai‘i remains very clear – 100 percent renewable energy with a transformation to a customer-centered utility focusing on smart meters, smart grid, distributed local solutions, and as much consumer choice as possible.""Media reports emerged in the lead-up to the decision that NextEra may have been cooling off its pursuit of the deal, instead eyeing a bid for Texas utility Oncor. Other reports have suggested possible interest in Hawaiian Electric from Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which also just reportedly bid for Oncor.NextEra already owns Florida Power & Light, the largest regulated electric utility in Florida, and NextEra Energy Resources, one of the biggest renewable developers in the U.S. Hawaiian Electric had previously been described by HEI CEO Connie Lau as NextEras ""snack"" on the way to a buffet of regulated utilities that it wants to acquire.The acquisition of HEI offered NextEra Energy an intriguing and immeasurable benefit: the opportunity to use Hawaiian Electric as a guinea pig to solve the challenges caused by high levels of renewable and distributed energy resources—well before they hit the mainland. Those are challenges many utilities are only starting to deal with across the continental U.S., but only Hawaiian Electric—and perhaps Californias investor-owned utilities—are experiencing in real-time.The deal comes at a time when the U.S. electric utility industry has been seeing a lot of merger activity in the last few years, with the broad trend of change driving many of those acquisitions. Thats because the U.S. has a friendly regulatory regime allowing for steady returns and safe investment, PwCs Jeremy Fago, who leads the firms power and utilities deals segment, recently told Utility Dive.“The U.S. is ripe for opportunity, given the massive changes were seeing in the country. Changes are happening and the opportunities are on the back end to deploy capital to really meet the infrastructure changeovers that are necessary in this country,” he said.Hawaii is at the forefront of those changes, often described in the power sector as being a ""postcard from the future."" It is one of the only places in the U.S. where rooftop solar and energy storage are already economical for many consumers at the residential level. Rooftop solar penetration in Hawaiian Electrics service territory is already well over 10%—the feared tipping point at which many in the industry believe utilities will start to see truly significant grid integration and business model challenges.This post has been updated to reflect the termination of the NextEra-Hawaiian Electric merger."

So far, both sides have steadfastly insisted that no job cuts or plant closures will result from the tie-up. We’ll see about that.In the meantime, we’ve compiled an alphabetical list of all the vehicles currently sold in Europe and in North America by the various FCA and PSA brands, along with the years they debuted. Weve gone into more detail about the European vehicles you might be less familiar with.The joint empire also has an antique stores worth of heritage-laced models and dormant brands, like Plymouth, Imperial, Simca, and Panhard, and it would have been even bigger had FCA not spun off Ferrari in early 2016.Alfa RomeoA legacy Italian sports car brand with roots in racing, Alfa Romeo has been struggling with declining U.S. sales.Giulia (2015): Alfa’s rear-wheel drive sports sedan competes against German luxury sedans in North America and Europe.4C (2013): The lightweight mid-engine rear-wheel-drive sports car is being phased out.Stelvio (2016): The Stelvio is a small luxury performance crossover that competes against the likes of the Porsche Macan and BMW X3 and is sold in both Europe and North America.Giulietta (2010): Sold in Europe, this compact hatchback is Alfa’s entry-level model. After initially planning a rear-wheel drive 2020 update, the Giulietta is reportedly being nixed as part of FCA’s latest product plans.ChryslerDespite lending its name to its parent company, questions abound about the future of this legendary but faded brand, which is not offered in Europe.300 (2011): Despite rumors of its pending demise, the four-door sedan lives on mostly unchanged for the 2020 model year, at least.Pacifica (2016): The successor to the Town & Country is Chrysler’s bestselling model by a long shot and comes in gas-only and plug-in hybrid versions.Voyager (2019): Chrysler’s newest minivan launches as its entry-level minivan for the 2020 model year. It’s essentially a rebadged version of lower trims of the Pacifica.CitroënKnown for spectacular quirkiness, Citroën has survived several near-death experiences since its creation in 1919. It was rescued by Peugeot in 1976, and the two have operated as sister companies since. Its positioned a little bit lower than its sibling, but its not a low-cost brand, either.Berlingo (2018): Like the Peugeot Rifter its mechanically identical to, the Berlingo is cheaper and more spacious than a comparably-sized crossover, so it caters to families with kids and a lot of gear to haul, as well as to adventurers looking for a daily driver that can effortlessly swallow mountain bikes and a long weekends worth of camping gear. The tradeoff is that it largely looks and drives like the commercial vehicle its based on.C-Zero (2010): The C-Zero is a badge-engineered Mitsubishi i-MiEV. We cant fathom how or why Citroën still sells it in 2019.C1 (2014): The smallest, most affordable member of the Citroën range isnt long for this world. Tightening safety and emissions regulations and thinning profit margins are poking holes in the cheap and the cheerful hatchbacks business case.C3 (2016): Citroën made its bread-and-butter model more SUV-like to increase its appeal. The look isnt to everyones tastes, but the C3 remains an excellent value for buyers seeking a cheap, basic and dependable commuter that rarely needs to stop for fuel.C3 Aircross (2017): The C3 Aircross took Citroën into the urban crossover segment for the first time. It looks a lot like a taller evolution of the C3 it shares its basic platform with, but it hasnt managed to match (let alone exceed) the popularity of the Renault Captur, one of its main rivals.C4 Cactus (2014): Believe it or not, the C4 Cactus (pictured) is Citroëns answer to the Volkswagen Golf. It started life as a crossover, but it became decidedly more car-like when the C4 hatchback retired without a direct successor in 2018. Citroën will allegedly axe the C4 Cactus and replace it with a true Golf-fighting model in the coming years.C4 Spacetourer (2013): The C4 Spacetourer was known as the C4 Picasso until 2018, when Citroën decided it no longer wanted to pay royalties to the painters family. Its one of the last vestiges of Europes vanishing minivan segment but its versatility is difficult to beat.C5 Aircross (2017): The C5 Aircross is built on the same bones as the Peugeot 5008, though the two crossovers look nothing alike. Autoblog understands it was developed largely for the Chinese market, but the rising popularity of high-riding models convinced executives to add it to the Citroën catalog in Europe to temporarily fill the gap left by the C5 sedan.E-Mehari (2016): This vaguely retro-styled interpretation of the original Mehari isnt a true Citroën; its made by Bolloré, the French company that built the BlueCar deployed in Indianapolis as part of a car-sharing service. Expensive and eye-wateringly slow, the E-Mehari is the textbook definition of a niche model. Consider yourself lucky if you spot one in the wild.DodgeFCA’s other O.G. American nameplate plays in the U.S. markets for performance enthusiasts and family haulers, but its models are getting long in the tooth.Challenger (2008): FCA’s brawny two-door muscle car still sells in good numbers despite 11 years without a redesign. It plays in the same sandbox as the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro.Charger (2011): A large rear-wheel-drive performance sedan that shares a platform with the Chrysler 300 and is slightly smaller than the Challenger. It’s Dodge’s second best-selling model after the Caravan.Durango (2011): Dodge’s midsize three-row SUV shares a platform with the Jeep Grand Cherokee.Grand Caravan (2007): FCA says the minivan will eventually go away, but it lives on for 2020, anyway, despite the advent of the similarly priced Chrysler Voyager.Journey (2007): The midsize SUV offers three rows of seating and competes against the likes of the Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento. Theres a redesign in the works and it could be made in Italy.DSPSA created DS in 2014 to take the fight directly to Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Thats easier said than done, and DS-badged cars still dont feel quite as nice as their German rivals. The brand risks overlapping with Alfa Romeo once PSA and FCA shack up.DS 3 Crossback (2018): Essentially a nicer evolution of the Peugeot 2008, the DS 3 Crossback perfectly illustrates the ongoing shift in the new car market. Its a four-door crossover developed to replace a two-door hatchback. Its built on PSAs modular platform, the one that will underpin numerous FCA products in the 2020s, and buyers can select an electric powertrain.DS 7 Crossback (2017): The DS 7 Crossback (pictured) suffers from a bland design thats a little too Audi-esque, and the firms lack of image has hampered its career in Europes German-dominated luxury car segment. The best place to see one in the wild is at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where Air France uses the model as a VIP shuttle.FiatThe Italian brand has a rich history, but its small cars haven’t made much of an impression on American car buyers.124 Spider (2015): A two-door convertible roadster for the U.S. that shares a platform with the Mazda Miata MX-5.500 (2007): Fiat’s most recognizable small car is being discontinued in the U.S., though it remains a hot seller in Europe.500X (2014): A small all-wheel-drive crossover sells far better in Europe than it does stateside.500L (2012): The five-seat, four-door compact wagon hasn’t done much to distinguish itself from U.S. competitors like the Honda Fit or Kia Soul. Its sales in Europe are dropping, too.Panda (2011): The third-generation Panda is Italys best-seller by a comfortable margin, but Fiat strongly hinted the model wont be replaced when it announced plans to exit the minicar segment in the early 2020s. The shockingly capable 4x4 model (pictured) is extremely popular in Europes mountainous regions, and credible rumors claim its underpinnings will serve as the foundation for an entry-level Jeep tentatively due out in the early 2020s.Tipo (2015): Fiats bargain-priced answer to the Volkswagen Golf and the Ford Focus is available as a hatchback, a sedan and a station wagon. The Tipo is more commonly seen on airport rental car lots than in private driveways due largely to a lack of image.Qubo (2007): The Qubo is a compact, city-friendly van Fiat developed jointly with PSA well before either company began hammering out the details of a merger. Peugeot and Citroën stopped offering their variants of it in 2017, but Fiat still manufactures the model (which is also available as a panel van named Fiorino) as of 2019. Its the smallest van sold on the European market.Doblo (2010): Built in people- and cargo-hauling configurations, the Doblo van is relatively popular in Italy, but its an also-ran elsewhere in Europe due in part to its age. Its rivals are considerably more modern. Its sold in the United States as the Ram ProMaster City.JeepThe off-road brand has its roots in U.S. Army vehicles and has become one of the most lucrative automotive brands on the planet. Revivals of the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer large SUVs are in the works.Cherokee (2013): The rugged midsize SUV is one of Jeep’s top-selling models in the U.S. and is also sold in Europe.Compass (2016): Jeep’s compact SUV is the smallest of the look-alike trio that also includes the Cherokee and Grand Cherokee. Also built in Melfi, Italy, including a PHEV version, and sold in more than 100 countries.Gladiator (2018): Essentially a Wrangler extended to become an off-road pickup truck with four doors, the Gladiator is in its first sales year in North America.Grand Cherokee (2009): Jeep’s best-selling model in the U.S. is also sold in Europe, where sales pale in comparison.Renegade (2014): Jeep’s compact SUV is getting a plug-in hybrid version for Europe and North America in 2020.Wrangler (2017): The boxy two- and four-door SUV with removable tops and doors is another hot-seller in the U.S that barely registers in Europe.LanciaLancia once made some of the most innovative and luxurious cars on the planet; it notably designed the first mass-produced V6. Years of mismanagement and a long string of half-baked, badge-engineered models left it utterly battered. Former FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne wanted to close the brand, but where it stands in 2019 is a little bit murky because the name has a lot of equity in Italy.Ypsilon (2011): Now sold exclusively in Italy, Lancias only remaining model is a four-door, upmarket-ish hatchback built on the same bones as the Fiat 500. Its old, and its likely the last Lancia well ever see, but it outsold the entire Alfa Romeo brand in Italy during the first nine months of 2019.MaseratiPart of Fiat since 2005, Maserati traces its founding to 1914 in Italy and today sells sports cars and luxury vehicles in more than 70 countries.Quattroporte (2013): The brand’s flagship is a full-size luxury sedan.Levante (2016): Maserati entered the crossover fray with its first SUV with a Ferrari-sourced V8, for now, powering its two highest trim models. It competes in North America and Europe against the Porsche Cayennes and BMW X6s of the world.Ghibli (2013): The sports sedan competes against four-door luxury cars like the Porsche Panamera and Audi A7.GranTurismo (2007): Maserati’s sports car is available as a coupe and convertible, and though the brand has dangled it above the scrap heap, the latest indication is that it will see a new generation in 2021.Opel/VauxhallOpel is Germanys other peoples car brand. It was gradually twinned with England-based Vauxhall during the 1970s, and their products have been identical with the exception of the badge on the grille ever since. Vauxhall is only present in the United Kingdom; Opel is more global. PSA purchased both automakers from General Motors in 2017, and performed a spectacular turnaround that brought them back to profitability in record time.Astra (2015): The Astra has rarely been an exciting car, and the current-generation model is absolutely no exception. Its overshadowed by French and German rivals; European sales fell by 27% in 2018, putting it in the 21st spot on the sales chart.Combo Life (2018): The Combo Life is the Opel/Vauxhall version of the Citroën Berlingo and the Peugeot Rifter. All three vans are identical under the sheet metal, and they overlap in many markets, but automotive jingoism runs strong in the segment, so the strategy makes sense. Germans would rather buy an Opel van than one with Peugeot badges.Corsa (2019): The current-generation Corsa (pictured) is built on the same platform as the Peugeot 208. Its far more interesting to look at than its predecessor, and its available with an electric powertrain, so its one of Opels most promising models. The difference in design and technology between the Astra and the Corsa demonstrates how the brand evolved under Peugeots ownership.Crossland X (2017): Closely related to the Citroën C3 Aircross, the Crossland X competes in a segment experiencing enormous growth, yet it hasnt been able to take full advantage of the markets shift towards high-riding models.Grandland X (2017): Opels variant of the Peugeot 3008 does reasonably well in Germany and in the United Kingdom, its home countries. Its not nearly as popular as its French rival on the European scene, however.Insignia (2017): If the Insignia looks familiar, its likely because its sold as the Buick Regal in the United States. Its a competent car, but its positioned in a segment of the market thats free-falling, and its future doesnt look markedly brighter than the Regals.PeugeotPeugeot began making cars in 1896, though it was founded in 1810 and spent most of the 19th century making bicycles, pepper mills and hand tools, among other products. It described itself as being ""between the Bugs and the Benz"" in the 1970s, but in 2019 its on about the same level as Volkswagen. Its image and cars improved exponentially during the 2010s.108 (2014): Peugeots entry-level model is twinned with the Citroën C1 and the Toyota Aygo. PSA strongly hinted it will leave the minicar segment in the coming years, so the 108 is on its way out without a replacement in sight. Toyota remains committed to it, however.208 (2019): The modular architecture found under the second-generation 208 (pictured) helped PSA seal the merger with FCA. Its modern, well-designed, and multi-energy, which allows Peugeot to offer gasoline-, diesel- and electricity-powered variants of the hatchback. The 208 is one of Europes best-selling models, and we expect the overhaul will move it up on the sales chart.2008 (2019): The second-generation 2008 is a strong entry into one of the most competitive segments of the European market. Positioned at the bottom of Peugeots crossover range, its built on the same platform as the 208, and its available with an electric powertrain.308 (2013): The 308 is one of Peugeots oldest cars, and it deserves a lot of credit for helping launch the brands turnaround, but it has never managed to give the Volkswagen Golf a run for its money. In Europe, Peugeot sold 155,925 units of the 308 in 2018, a number that put the model in 24th place. The aging seventh-generation Golf led the market with 445,754 sales.3008 (2016): The second-generation 3008 was the first model released after Carlos Tavares took PSAs reigns, and it was the right car at the right time. It became one of the 10 best-selling cars in France a few short months after deliveries began. It remains one of the brands most popular models; it was the 14th best-seller in Europe in 2018, and the third best-seller in France.508 (2018): Peugeot defiantly argued theres still a strong case to be made for large sedans when it redesigned the 508. Also available as a station wagon, its characterized by a sharp, head-turning design and user-friendly in-car technology.5008 (2016): Peugeots answer to the Toyota RAV4 and the Volkswagen Tiguan is better-tailored to the American market than any of the companys other models. Its a stretched variant of the 3008 with seven seats, though we wouldnt recommend trying to shoehorn adults in the third row.Rifter (2018): The Rifter is the passenger-carrying variant of the Partner; think of it as Frances answer to the Ford Transit Connect. The segment it competes in was huge during the 2000s but buyers gradually left as they caught crossover fever. It nonetheless appeals to a small but loyal group of motorists who value practicality more than they care about style.RamFormerly the nameplate of a Dodge truck, Ram was spun off as its own truck brand in 2009. Along with Jeep, it’s one of Fiat Chrysler’s cash cows, a volume and profits generator. Former CEO Sergio Marchionne even discussed the possibility of spinning it and Jeep off into their own companies.1500 (2018): A rugged full-size pickup beloved by many truck enthusiasts that competes with the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado for U.S. truck primacy. The last-generation model is still available and is called the 1500 Classic.2500/3500 (2019): Heavy-duty trucks.ProMaster (2006): Ram’s work van, available in many configurations.ProMaster City (2010): See Fiat Doblo."

III, which would make it the first publicly traded company specifically focused on commercializing quantum-computing hardware and software.College Park, Md.-based IonQ on Monday said it intends to file paperwork in about a week with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a special-purpose acquisition company deal valuing the combined entity at about $2 billion. The deal will need approval from the SEC and SPAC shareholders.“It is kind of a groundbreaking moment in history,” said Peter Chapman, chief executive of IonQ and formerly director of engineering for Amazon. com Inc.’s Amazon Prime business.IonQ is competing against several companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. , Microsoft Corp. , Alphabet Inc.’s Google and D-Wave Systems Inc., trying to commercialize quantum computing using various technological approaches. No scalable, commercial-grade quantum computer has been built yet.A prototype chip package that uses the same technology as IonQ’s existing systems and will be integrated into a quantum-computing device about the size of an Xbox game console. Photo: IonQ“The race for quantum computing is real,” said Matthew Brisse, research vice president at tech research firm Gartner Inc. “We’re seeing quantum [computing] come out of the labs and get into the digital economy.”By 2023, 20% of global organizations, including governments and companies, are expected to budget for quantum-computing projects, up from less than 1% in 2018, according to Gartner.SPACs are an increasingly popular source of financing for companies, including those with little to no revenue looking to go public. Since the start of last year, investors have poured more than $130 billion into SPACs, The Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 26.If the deal goes through, IonQ will have raised $734 million in funding since its founding in 2015, including $300 million through its planned merger with dMY Technology III and another $350 million in private investment funding from Hyundai Motor Co. ; Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an investment organization led by Bill Gates and focused on mitigating the effects of climate change; and others. The company also has raised $84 million in venture-capital funding.Quantum computers aim to harness the power of quantum physics to sort through a vast number of possibilities within a fraction of a second to come up with a probable solution. The technology could speed up calculations related to finance, drug and materials discovery, artificial intelligence and others, and crack many of the defenses used to secure the internet.Newsletter Sign-up WSJ | CIO Journal The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. PREVIEWThe money raised from the transaction will be used to help IonQ manufacture a quantum-computing machine that works at room temperature and is about the size of an Xbox videogame console, Mr. Chapman said. That would be significantly smaller than early-stage machines on the market today, without requiring the supercooling necessary to achieve quantum mechanical effects.IonQ expects the device to be completed in 2023.IonQ’s technological approach involves commercializing university lab research on trapped ions, which naturally exhibit the quantum mechanical effects needed for the machines to work, Mr. Chapman said.The company has given about 20 million software developers access to its current early-stage quantum-computing device through partnerships with cloud-computing service providers Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. It expects to generate more than $1 million in revenue this year, Mr. Chapman said.Related Video Private companies are flooding to special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to bypass the traditional IPO process and gain a public listing.

Bracewell and Baker Botts were the respective legal advisers."

Then, JetBlue stepped in with a bigger offer for Spirit, surprising many industry analysts and experts. Both deals would face scrutiny from Biden administration regulators, who have expressed more skepticism about consolidation than their predecessors.Some analysts contend that Spirit and Frontier are better suited to merge because they operate under similar “ultra-low-cost” business models but have more extensive flights in different parts of the United States. A JetBlue-Spirit combination could be more difficult to pull off because the airlines’ business models are quite different. But the deal could allow JetBlue to compete more effectively against the nation’s four dominant airlines.JetBlue’s updated offer added a handful of concessions to address Spirit’s concerns about regulatory approval, including an offer to divest some assets from both airlines. JetBlue also said it would commit to divesting Spirit assets in New York and Boston, markets at the heart of JetBlue’s partnership with American, known as the Northeast Alliance, in an effort to win approval from the Justice Department. JetBlue also said it would pay Spirit a $200 million fee if antitrust regulators blocked the deal.Spirit’s leadership responded in a letter to JetBlue’s chief executive on Monday, saying they did not think that the updated offer had a reasonable chance of succeeding. Regulators, Spirit said, were likely to be “very concerned” with the prospect that JetBlue’s offer would result in higher costs, and subsequently higher fares for consumers. Spirit said converting its planes, which are densely packed with seats, to JetBlue’s roomier configuration would result in higher prices, for example."

The merger, which would have made the combined entity the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., had garnered a lot of negative attention since it was announced in February of 2014. In this piece, we take a look at why the deal was called off and where the two companies stand in the wake of this development.See our complete analysis for ComcastWhat HappenedSince its announcement, the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger consistently faced stringent opposition from the general public, industry players, as well as public interest and consumer-advocacy groups. There had been indications in the last few days that the deal would find it difficult to get the required regulatory approvals, with staff attorneys at the U.S. Justice Departments antitrust division stating that they were nearing a recommendation to block the deal, and the FCC staff recommending a procedural move that would put the merger in jeopardy. With the dissenting voices increasing, Comcast decided that the best course of action would be to drop the merger plans altogether. There is no break-up fee involved so the pay-TV provider will not be penalized for walking away from the deal.Why The Regulators Were Against The DealFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued a statement on the latest developments, which made it clear why he was opposed to the merger. It was the potential power that the combined entity would have yielded in the high speed internet market that worried him the most. Earlier in the year, the FCC changed its definition of broadband Internet by revising the required download speeds to 25 Mbps or faster as opposed to the earlier speed limit of 4 Mbps. Under the earlier definition, the combined entity would have represented just under 37% of the high speed internet market with TWC and Comcast accounting for 13% and 24% respectively. However, Comcasts market share jumps to approximately 57% under the revised definition of broadband services. Critics of the merger have argued that Comcast could use its considerable power in the broadband market to disrupt online streaming services. These streaming services have been slowly chipping away at cable pay-TV services for a while now and both TWC and Comcast have lost pay-TV subscribers as a result. Clearly, Wheeler agreed with this view as he noted that ""the proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation especially given the growing importance of high-speed broadband to online video and innovative new services.""Where Do The Companies Stand Now?ComcastThe merger was expected to help the combined entitys pay-TV business the most and could potentially have had an impact on the rising content costs. The combined entity would have serviced roughly 30% of the pay-TV market and would have gained significant leverage on the distribution front. Moreover, the combined entity would have benefited from the merger synergies, especially on the advertising front. The two companies had said that the transaction would generate approximately $1.5 billion in operating synergies. However, Comcast is not overly dependent on the now-defunct merger for growth. The company has performed well in its high speed internet and pay-TV businesses in the recent past. Comcast added 1.28 million high speed internet subscribers last year to take its subscriber tally to 21.96 million subscribers at the end of 2014. The company also added pay-TV subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was a reversal from the subscriber losses in the previous two quarters. Comcasts pay-TV subscriber base currently stands at 22.38 million.The improved subscriber numbers are largely due to triple play bundling. Triple play bundling is the combining of the three services offered by Comcast — pay-TV, high speed internet and voice — into one package. This bundling helps reduce the subscription fees for subscribers as it saves on infrastructure costs and leads to operational efficiencies and economies of scale.The companys media arm, NBCUniversal grew 7.5% last year and reported revenues in excess of $25 billion. NBCU contributes more than 32% to Comcasts stock value, according to our estimates. Universal Studios is an integral part of this segment, bringing in approximately $5 billion in revenues last year. In the age of big-budget movies, the studio is making money off of movies that are produced at a very reasonable budget. The studio produced or distributed fifteen movies in 2014 and eleven of those had a budget of $40 million or less. Low budget movies have lower risk attached to them and recover their costs if they have one or two good weeks at the box-office. The studio has also invested in lucrative movie franchises such as The Fast And The Furious, Fifty Shades, Despicable Me, Jurassic Park, etc., which will serve the studio well in the years to come. NBCs broadcasting business has also been performing exceptionally well in the last few years, bringing in over $8.5 billion in revenues last year. NBC finished the 2013-14 primetime season as the number one ranked broadcasting network in the coveted 18-49 demographic. The network has a dependable roster of shows, including The Voice, The Blacklist, Chicago Fire, Grimmand Chicago P.D., and we believe that NBCs broadcasting revenues can cross $13 billion in the next six to seven years.Time Warner CableSimilar to Comcast, all is not lost for TWC. Charter Communications has consistently expressed interest in acquiring TWC and Charter?s advisors have reportedly reached out to begin friendly talks on a merger. The company had also made a failed bid for TWC in early 2014. Charter is the fifth largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with just under 4.2 million subscribers and also provides Internet services to more than 5 million subscribers. Just like the Comcast-TWC deal, Charters potential merger with TWC would also generate operating efficiencies. Furthermore, the deal with Charter would face less regulatory scrutiny compared to the Comcast deal, as the potential combined market shares in both the pay-TV and Internet businesses would be smaller.TWC has also been doing well for itself lately. (Read More - Why We Are Revising Our Price Estimate For Time Warner Cable) The subscriber numbers were very positive for the company last year. The full year increase to the high speed Internet subscriber base was 657,000 as compared to 211,000 in 2013. The company also lost fewer Pay-TV subscribers in 2014 as compared to the previous year. The company was able to avoid the lower customer satisfaction levels and frequent blackouts of various networks witnessed in the past and it will be interesting to see if it can maintain this momentum. For the year 2015, we estimate the companys revenues will be around $23.8 billion, compared to consensus estimate of $23.9 billion, and an EPS of $8.28, compared to a consensus estimate of $8.10.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapMore Trefis ResearchLike our charts?

Rocket LabRocket Lab began trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, becoming the latest space company to close a SPAC merger and go public — and adding substantially to its cash pile in the process. ""Were super excited to bring a high-quality space asset to the market,"" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told CNBC. The company merged with special purpose acquisition company Vector Acquisition, which valued Rocket Lab at $4.8 billion in equity. The deal, and the $777 million in gross proceeds from it, will help the company grow its core small rocket business, further expand its spacecraft unit, and build a larger rocket called Neutron to take on Elon Musks SpaceX. ""Its a tremendous amount of capital ... really puts us in a position not only to be aggressive in our organic growth but aggressive on our inorganic growth as well,"" Beck said. A SPAC raises money from investors through an initial public offering and then uses the cash to acquire a private company and take it public. Shares of Rocket Lab declined 9.9% in trading on Wednesday to close at $10.43. Asked about the stocks debut slide, Beck said he hasnt ""really even been watching it"" and emphasized that, ""at the end of the day, were in this for the long term."" Rocket Lab is among a trend of space companies going public through SPAC deals, with Virgin Galactic the first of the recent generation, in 2019. Rocket builder Astra, satellite broadband focused AST & Science, satellite data service Spire Global, and space delivery specialist Momentus have each begun trading. BlackSky, Redwire, Satellogic, and Planet are expected to follow in the coming months. ""I dont think it will take long for investors to differentiate between the company thats consistently delivering and the ones that have aspirations to deliver sometime in the future,"" Beck said.A maturing space businessA step further with NeutronNeutron, more than twice as tall as Electron and capable of carrying as much as 8,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit, is Rocket Labs step up the rocket food chain. The cash from going public is crucial to Neutron, as Rocket Lab expects to spend about $200 million to develop the next-generation rocket. Rocket Lab aims to launch Neutron for the first time by 2024. Rocket Lab earlier this month updated its investor presentation with a slide saying that a ""significant Neutron reveal"" is ""coming soon."" Beck, when asked what the announcement will be about, said, ""Were so sick of people copying us."" ""Were holding our cards closer to our chest on Neutron,"" Beck said. ""Neutron should look like a rocket [designed] in 2050, right?""CEO Peter Beck stands at the base of the fairing, or nosecone, of the Neutron rocket the company is developing. Rocket Lab"

""You cant make discoveries in a population if you dont have those people participating. We need the right customers and to represent the product back to them in the right way.""It faced FDA scrutiny earlier in its history; continues to face questions about consumer privacy as it gathers genetic information on millions of individuals; ran into financial challenges in recent years as the market for personalized genetic tests seemed to get saturated; skepticism over the basis for its gene-based risk analysis remains contentious; and as it dives deeper into drug development, a gap in its current customer base and underlying genetic data between a majority European genetic profile and underrepresentation of many minority and ethnic groups.23andMe, a five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, has not had a straight or sure path to success as a public company.Founded by Anne Wojcicki — the former spouse of Google founder Sergey Brin, who was an early investor in the company — 23andMe was created 15 years ago. Along with Ancestry, it has helped pioneer the idea that genetic testing is not just a medical field, but a big consumer business. Its at-home testing kits, which allowed people to learn about their genetic profiles and ancestry by sending a bit of saliva through the mail, ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, though not without controversy.23andMe shares rose by 21% on the Nasdaq in its first day of trading as a public company.Personalized medicine and at-home genetic testing kit company 23andMe went public on Thursday through a merger with a Richard Branson SPAC, VG Acquisition Corp., in a deal that raised near-$600 million and valued the company at $3.5 billion.Wojcicki says the company sees big things ahead for both its consumer and drug research & development platforms. Roughly 80% of 23andMes now-11 million members opt into sharing their genetic information (de-identified) for research in drug development.""Our genetics represent all of life on this planet, and we have the opportunity to understand what it means and with that, it will improve your own life but also contribute to all kinds of research discoveries,"" Wojcicki said.She says the controversy over the medical utility of the information when put in the hands of consumers wont go away, and it ranges on a spectrum from critical, clinical information, such as mutations in the gene that causes breast cancer, BRCA, to ""more controversial"" genetic information on Alzheimers Disease variants. Some individuals with higher risk of blood clots make the decision to walk around more during plane flights as a result of their 23andMe reports.But she added that consumers have shown they want this information to help them make decisions.She said in the case of Alzheimers risk, ""This information ... really influences how they live their life ... how they plan to retire ... plan to be older.""Her own 10-year-old son used the companys lactose intolerance analysis to diagnose his stomach aches and Wojcicki herself, while reticent to discuss her personal use of the product, did say as the daughter of a woman who suffered from breast cancer and who has a higher risk of the disease, the information does influence her decision on having that ""recreational glass of wine.""""The last 15 years was putting together the infrastructure for how we can take off, proving to consumers we can get the information and proving they can understand it without a medical professional,"" she said.She says the key to its future is that consumers want to use the information to not only change their life but contribute to drug discovery.23andMe has 40 programs underway on its drug discovery platform.""We want them to truly have a personalized health-care experience and ... benefit the human genome from seeing all of this aggregated data turned into therapeutic programs,"" Wojcicki said. ""When I think about the future of therapeutics, in the next five years it is really about moving these programs forward and getting them into the clinic.""The company also recently launched a subscription product to introduce more content and services for consumers who want to take additional steps after their genetic reports.""We get thousands of people who call every week to the customer care team who would like to know how to use this information and apply it to live a healthier longer life,"" she said.The IPO market has already set an annual record for deal volume in 2021, at $171 billion, and only halfway through the year. Average first day trade gains in deals this year have been above 40%.

Executives for both companies said they hope the deal will make investors more confident, driving up share prices.Apollo, which helped create Athene in 2009 and manages its money for a fee, owns 35% of Athenes stock. It will buy out the outstanding shares at an agreed-upon price, subject to approval from Athenes other shareholders.The companies expect to complete the merger in January 2022.Driving the move: Executives for both Athene and Apollo feel investors are not properly valuing the life insurance company on the stock exchange.Since going public in December 2016, the price of Athenes stock has been relatively flat, growing from about $44 a share at the time to about $49 a share at the end of the day Friday. That, despite the fact that the companys holdings have grown significantly by acquiring businesses from other companies like Voya Financial.Athenes net income more than doubled, from $805 million in 2016 to $1.92 billion last year.Athene has about 1,300 employees and sells annuities, a form of life insurance that provides investors fixed payments after retiring. According to LIMRA, a financial services research agency, Athene sold the 10th-most annuities in the United States in 2020.In particular, Athene led the country in sales of fixed indexed annuities, a form of investment that pays money to customers based on an agreed-upon rate, such as how much the Standard & Poors 500 Index is growing.Athene profits by investing the up-front payments, betting it will earn more than it needs to pay out and can keep the ""spread.""""We consistently outperform the asset side of our balance sheet,"" Belardi said on a call with investors Monday. ""This helps us generate more spread than others.""Executives for both companies hope that the merger will create a stock price thats greater than the current combined value of Apollo and Athene. Piper Sandler analyst John Barnidge said both companies are operating on the theory that public investors simply dont value life insurance businesses as much as they should.In part, thats because financial companies that earn money on a spread arent as consistent as those that make money by charging fees for their services. Executives at Apollo ""generally have long-term outlooks,"" Barnidge said.""Athene is really good at selling fixed index annuities,"" he said. ""Its a good investment product for near-retirees. That product is growing. A lot of people are retiring. This is good for those products. Thats where Apollo comes in.""Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan said merging with Athene could create a small amount of momentum that eventually snowballs. If the combined value of all of the shares of the company — the market capitalization — increases enough, the S&P Dow Jones Indices may add Apollo to the S&P 500 Index.Institutional investors, who buy shares of every company in the index, would in turn have to purchase Apollo shares. That could drive the stock price up even more.Rowan said the merger could boost investors confidence in other ways. Currently, Apollo is reliant on Athenes business. It represents about 30% of Apollos revenue. While the companies are tied together, some investors wonder how badly Apollos business would be damaged if somehow Athene split away.""While [the relationship] has been to everyone’s benefit thus far,"" Rowan said, ""that concern has remained.""Other Des Moines-based life insurance companies are going through shake-ups driven by stock prices.FBL Financial Group will cease to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as part of a similar merger with Farm Bureau Property & Casualty. FBLs stock price had fallen about 28% in the two years leading up to the decision.Principal Financial Group, meanwhile, announced last month that it is reviewing its business operations. Analysts believe that, at the urging of activist investor Elliott Management Corp., Principal will explore selling its life insurance division.Tyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Des Moines Register.

The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump’s hotel.","Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareLast April, telecom giant T-Mobile announced a megadeal: a $26 billion merger with rival Sprint, which would more than double T-Mobile’s value and give it a huge new chunk of the cellphone market. But for T-Mobile, one hurdle remained: Its deal needed approval from the Trump administration. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The next day, in Washington, staffers at the Trump International Hotel were handed a list of incoming “VIP Arrivals.” That day’s list included nine of T-Mobile’s top executives — including its chief operating officer, chief technology officer, chief strategy officer and chief financial officer, and its outspoken celebrity chief executive, John Legere.The executives had scheduled stays of up to three days. But it was not their last visit.Instead, T-Mobile executives have returned to President Trump’s hotel repeatedly since then, according to eyewitnesses and hotel documents obtained by The Washington Post.AdvertisementBy mid-June, seven weeks after the announcement of the merger, hotel records indicated that one T-Mobile executive was making his 10th visit to the hotel. Legere appears to have made at least four visits to the Trump hotel, walking the lobby in his T-Mobile gear.These visits highlight a stark reality in Washington, unprecedented in modern American history. Trump the president works at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Trump the businessman owns a hotel at 1100 Pennsylvania.Countries, interest groups and companies such as T-Mobile — whose future will be shaped by the administration’s choices — are free to stop at both, and to pay the president’s company while also meeting with officials in his government. Such visits raise questions about whether patronizing Trump’s private business is viewed as a way to influence public policy, critics said.The Trump International Hotel inside the federally owned Old Post Office building in downtown D.C. has been mired in controversy even before opening its doors. (Video: Claritza Jimenez, Osman Malik, Jonathan OConnell/The Washington Post)AdvertisementLast week, a Post reporter spotted Legere in the Trump hotel’s lobby. In an impromptu interview, the T-Mobile chief executive said he was not seeking special treatment. He chose the Trump hotel, he said, for its fine service and good security.“It’s become a place I feel very comfortable,” Legere said. He also praised the hotel’s location, next to one of the departments that must approve the company’s merger.“At the moment I am in town for some meetings at the Department of Justice,” Legere said. “And it’s very convenient for that.”After The Post published a version of this article online Wednesday, a Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission — which would have to approve the merger — tweeted her concern. “This does not look good,” Commissioner Jessica Rosenwo rcel wrote, making note of the report.AdvertisementLater in the day, Legere used Twitter to respond: “Wow - A lot of attention on where I choose to stay in DC,” he wrote, continuing, “I trust regulators will make their decision based on the benefits it will bring to the US, not based on hotel choices.”The potential conflict of interest posed by Trump’s dual roles in Washington was underscored in a separate development Wednesday, when the General Services Administration’s internal watchdog issued a scathing report of the agency’s decision-making that allowed the president to keep his lease for the hotel, which is in a federally owned building.It said the agency should have assessed whether the lease violates the Constitution’s emoluments clauses, which bar presidents from taking payments from foreign governments and U.S. states. But it “improperly ignored” those concerns, the report said.The VIP Arrivals lists obtained by The Post — in which Trump hotel executives alerted their staff to foreign officials, corporate executives, long-term guests, Trump family friends and big spenders — provide an inside look at some of the hotel’s customers. The Post obtained lists for about a dozen days in 2018.AdvertisementThose lists showed 38 nights of hotel stays by the T-Mobile executives; because The Post’s data is incomplete, the number could be higher.Rooms at the luxury hotel routinely cost more than $300 per night.The Post shared details about those stays — gleaned from the VIP Arrivals lists and eyewitness accounts — with T-Mobile and the Trump Organization. Neither challenged the findings. After Legere’s brief interview at the Trump hotel, T-Mobile declined to comment further for this report.Trump’s hotel also has hosted parties put on by the Kuwaiti and Philippine embassies, rented hundreds of rooms to lobbyists paid by Saudi Arabia and hosted a large meeting of the oil industry’s lobbying group.But the T-Mobile case stands out because the company’s executives were expected at the hotel so soon after announcing they needed a win in Washington.Advertisement“It’s currying favor with the president,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “It’s disturbing, because it’s another secret avenue for currying favor with the government.”She said that even if they were not directly ordered by Trump, the president’s appointees might feel pressured to help Trump’s customers. That might undermine public confidence in the decisions that result, Krumholz said.The White House did not respond to requests for comment.Eric Trump — who is running the family business with his brother, Donald Trump Jr., while his father serves in the White House — said in an email that the hotel has “absolutely no role in politics.” Asked about the stays by Legere, Eric Trump said that his hotel offers extraordinary service: “It should come as no surprise that a CEO of a major corporation would want to stay with us.”AdvertisementBefore last year, Washington had been a place of disappointment for T-Mobile, which is the third-biggest of the United States’ four big cellphone providers and has long sought a merger to grow bigger.In 2011 and in 2014, the Bellevue, Wash.-based company planned to combine with rivals — first AT&T, then Sprint. Both times, the Obama administration rejected the mergers on antitrust grounds, saying they would decrease competition and hurt consumers.On April 29, 2018, T-Mobile announced it would try again with Sprint.The deal would require approval from agencies including the Justice Department, which handles antitrust enforcement, and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the airwaves that cellphones use. Those two agencies declined to comment.Sprint, the market’s fourth-place player, is largely owned by SoftBank, a Japanese company whose founder, Masayoshi Son, has built his own relationship with Donald Trump. After Trump’s election, Son was praised by the incoming president for a promise to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. Sprint declined to comment for this report.AdvertisementLegere, the T-Mobile chief executive, also had a history with the president.But it wasn’t a good one.“I will obviously leave your hotel right away,” Legere wrote on Twitter in April 2015, during a public spat that began with complaints about Legere’s stay at a Trump hotel in New York and escalated when Trump called T-Mobile’s service “terrible.”Later, Legere mocked Trump’s hotels after checking out. “I am so happy to wake up in a hotel where every single item isn’t labeled ‘Trump,’ ” he wrote, according to news coverage. Those tweets appear to have been deleted.Three years later, on the day after the Sprint merger was announced, Legere was scheduled to arrive at the Trump hotel in Washington.That day’s VIP Arrivals list had 39 names. There were executives at a Defense Department contractor called AxleTech; a spokesman said they chose the hotel because they had a meeting at a corporate office across the street. Two other VIPs were connected with the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action, which was hosting a dinner with the president at the hotel that night. A spokeswoman said one room was for the event photographer, the other for staff preparations.AdvertisementAnd there were the nine T-Mobile executives. Of them, only Legere was listed with an “R” next to his name — signaling to Trump hotel employees that he was a repeat Trump customer.Inside the hotel’s busy, soaring lobby, Legere was noticed quickly.“Everybody knew. You couldn’t miss it,” said Jake Loft, who was in the lobby for a regularly scheduled networking event. He spotted Legere by his outfit, which was — as usual — a walking billboard for T-Mobile. Legere wore a black-and-magenta hoodie with a T-Mobile logo over a bright magenta T-shirt with another T-Mobile logo. “He wasn’t dressed appropriately,” Loft said.Tim Briseno, who was there with Loft, said that “it was essentially like a track suit.” Briseno remembered Legere giving out business cards, with an offer of a discount. “He was like, ‘If you guys switch, you’ll get 40 percent off for the rest of your life.’ ” T-Mobile did not respond to a query asking whether that offer was legitimate.They asked Legere for a photo.“I didn’t look at the photo until after I left,” Loft said. Legere had given them both bunny ears. “I was like, ‘That was good.’ ”Legere wound up in several photos on Instagram, giving bunny ears in every one.On that first visit, some of the T-Mobile executives were expected to stay up to three days, according to the VIP Arrivals list.In late May, the Trump hotel expected T-Mobile’s general counsel, David Miller, for a return visit, staying two days. Then, on June 17, the VIP Arrivals list showed that Legere, Miller and T-Mobile Executive Vice President David Carey would be returning for five-day stays.By that time — six weeks after the merger was announced — the list shows that the T-Mobile executives were already experienced Trump customers. Legere and Carey were members of the “Trump Card” program. Carey’s entry also contained the notation “R(10).”That — according to Trump hotel staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to comment to the media — was an indication that Carey was making his 10th visit to the hotel. The listings also contained the words “Long Term” because of the length of their stays. Carey and Miller did not respond to requests for comment.Lewandowski is a frequent patron of the Trump hotel. He has held two book parties there and often appears in social media photos mingling in the lobby. Lewandowski did not return requests for comment this week.The visits by T-Mobile executives cumulatively are probably worth tens of thousands of dollars to the Trump Organization, which the president still owns despite criticism from government ethics experts.Since Trump was elected, his hotel has been patronized by other groups with lobbying interests in Washington: foreign embassies, industry associations, religious groups. Lobbyists working for the Saudi government — a close U.S. ally that has grown closer under Trump — paid for 500 hotel rooms in the four months after Trump was elected.Opponents of the T-Mobile merger say they believe the executives’ repeated stays are an effort to influence policy.“I can’t believe this is a coincidence. In mergers, companies look for any potential advantage they can find,” said Gene Kimmelman, who was chief counsel in the Justice Department’s antitrust division under President Barack Obama. He now leads the government-watchdog group Public Knowledge.Kimmelman said he doubted that career Justice Department officials would be moved by it but said it could “sway others in government” appointed by Trump.Daniel Schuman of the liberal group Demand Progress is part of a coalition opposing the merger, arguing that it would reduce choice for consumers. The 4Competition Coalition also includes labor unions and some smaller cellphone providers.“This isn’t justice with a blindfold on, right?” he said. “It creates a fundamental corruption in the way that the work of the American people is done.”Analysts say Legere’s shares in the company will probably grow if the merger is approved.In the interview at the Trump hotel last week, Legere said that although the hotel was clearly a place to be seen, he did not believe the president knew about his staying there.Did he expect that his staying there might earn his company any special treatment?“Certainly not,” he said. “I don’t know why it would.”Sometime after that interview, Legere apparently checked out of the Trump hotel. By the next evening, Legere was tweeting about the great bar at “my current DC hotel” — the Four Seasons in Georgetown.Brian Fung contributed to this report.GiftOutline Gift Article"

Unity laid off about 4% of its employees last month, following turmoil in the public markets.“The combination of Unity and ironSource better supports creators of all sizes by giving them all the tools they need to create and grow successful apps in gaming and other consumer-facing verticals like e-commerce,” Unity CEO John Riccitiello said in a statement. “This is a step further toward realizing our vision of a fully integrated platform.”Market motivationThe merger announcement shows some companies are taking advantage of the market downturn and lower stock prices to consolidate. Tech companies in particular have taken a beating in the public markets and seen their valuations plummet as rising inflation and interest rates have spooked investors.San Francisco-based Unity makes video game software development technology, while Tel Aviv-based ironSource’s technology provides a business platform for app developers.Once the deal closes, current Unity stockholders will own 73.5% of the combined company, and current IronSource stockholders will own 26.5%, according to the company.

With the addition of Starwood’s portfolio, the new Marriott now has 30 brands with more than 5,700 hotels. That amounts to 1.1 million rooms in more than 110 countries, making Marriott the largest hotel company in the world.Members of the Marriott Rewards program and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) were immediately able to link their accounts at Members.marriott.com to begin earning and redeeming points at all those hotels.“We did want to deliver real benefits to our customers immediately,” Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, who is leading the combined company, said during an interview with USA TODAY prior to the close. The two programs will remain separate while Marriott works on technology and product enhancements, Sorenson says.The highly anticipated merger had a few starts and stops since the deal was reached in November 2015. A Chinese insurance consortium, Anbang, swooped in with a counter-offer that Starwood seriously considered for several weeks earlier this year. Anbang eventually dropped its bid. Then Chinese regulatory authorities, whose approval Marriott needed for the merger in order to operate properties in that coveted market, requested an extension of the review process.Chinese authorities gave their final approval last week, clearing the way for the merger to be finalized.Sorenson said the merger will more than double the company’s presence in such lucrative regions as Asia, the Middle East and Africa.The alliance is the biggest hotel merger in years, but it is not the only one. InterContinental Hotels group acquired boutique chain Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants last year. AccorHotels purchased the Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissôtel brands this year. Destination Hotels and Commune Hotels have merged.Many have likened the consolidation of the hotel industry to that of the airlines.But Gray Shealy, executive director of the Masters of Hospitality Management Program at Georgetown University, says the Marriott-Starwood merger is likely to be less rocky.“They’ve had tons and tons of time to prepare for it,” he says. “If anyone is going to do it as smoothly as possible it would be Marriott. Airline operations are so wildly different than hotel operations.”David Loeb, senior hotel research analyst at Baird, says consumers will have a lot more options within the Marriott family, but perhaps not across the entire industry.“It will be tougher and tougher for smaller companies to compete,” he says. “Consumers do like choice.”With the merger, Marriott has acquired such luxury Starwood brands as St. Regis and W Hotels. Those will complement Marriott’s The Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, and EDITION.Marriott will also inherit lifestyle brands such as Aloft, which will operate in the same category as Moxy and AC Hotels. The Marriott Hotels brand will co-exist with Sheraton.Sorenson says he will retain the existing brands, even if they appeal to similar customers.“We think we’re advantaged and our customers are advantaged by having more choice, not less,” he said.That doesn’t mean Marriott won’t look to improve any brands. Marriott plans to ""provide as clear a distinction as we can between the brands in terms of product and service so that our customers can have a sense of what each brand stands for,"" Sorenson says.For instance, he said, Starwoods Element, an eco-friendly lifestyle brand, now has just 22 properties worldwide. Sorenson would like to see more growth there.Another Starwood brand that needs some attention is Sheraton, he said.“I suspect over the course of the next few years, we will work on strengthening the position of that brand and hopefully driving better returns for owners for all those hotels,” he said.As for the loyalty program, Marriott has already made some decisions. The combined programs have 85 million members.Members of both Marriott Rewards, which include The Ritz-Carlton frequent guests, and SPG will have their status matched. If they link their accounts, they will be able to transfer and redeem points at a three-to-one ratio. Three Marriott Rewards points will equal one SPG Starpoint. That will apply to redemption stays and the Marriott Rewards Experiences Marketplace and SPG’s Moments platform. Those programs allow members to redeem points for exclusive experiences, such as sporting events.Loyalty program experts praised the initial execution.""Marriott nailed it with their 3:1 transfer ratio,” says Gary Leff, a travel industry expert who studies rewards programs.He says Starwood is also known for its better treatment of top guests, offering perks such as suite upgrades and fewer limits on complimentary breakfast.“Until we know how Starwood’s best elite benefits and lifetime status will work, and whether the unique partnerships Starwood has forged with airlines like Delta, Emirates, and China Eastern survive the merger, members will continue to be in wait and see mode,” he says.Loeb says he expects Marriott to “go out of its way to be very good to Starwood’s elite guests.”“They will do all they can to engender loyalty across the family of brands,” he says. “I think that’s a very important strategic goal to them.”Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com, says that as an elite member of both programs, he’s pleased so far with how Marriott is handling the merger of the programs.“My biggest fear was that they were going to take benefits away or do a one-size-fits-all approach of Marriott is it,” he says. “They haven’t, at least not yet ….This merger is so big they don’t have to follow in the lead of airline mergers. And in the hotel space, there’s never been a hotel merger of this magnitude with these loyalty programs.”"

The companies secured the final approval they needed on Friday after New Jersey regulators consented to the merger.“We are pleased to have completed this transformative merger, thus making us the premier leader in gaming and hospitality,” said Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., in a statement. “We look forward to executing on the numerous opportunities ahead to create value for all stakeholders.”More:Eldorado Resorts merging with Caesars in $17.3 billion deal, creates largest US gaming co.The merger further bolsters the regional presence of the combined companies, which now either own or operate gaming properties in 16 U.S. states, including Nevada, Colorado, Louisiana and New Jersey. The merged gaming entity, which keeps the Caesars name, counts 55 casino properties under its umbrella, which includes international properties as well.While company leadership lauded the completion of the deal, the merger also occurs in a much different gaming environment compared to what Eldorado and Caesars faced when they first agreed to a $17.3 billion deal last year.The merger was originally supposed to be completed during the first half of the 2020 but ended up being delayed as both companies scrambled to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eldorado Resorts, for example, ended up selling properties such as the Montbleu Resort Casino and Spa in Lake Tahoe and Eldorado Shreveport Resort and Casino in Louisiana at a significantly reduced price of $155 million to Twin River Worldwide Holdings in preparation for the merger. Maverick Gaming initially agreed to buy the properties at a higher price before backing out after the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the industry.Eldorado and Caesars also had to deal with a shutdown of their Nevada properties after Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses in the state in late March. Nevada casinos were closed for several months before being allowed to reopen starting on June 4.With the merger, the new Caesars will have to navigate a challenging economic environment while also dealing with about $8.8 billion in liabilities. The company pointed to its large reach as well as operating efficiencies resulting from the merger as key advantages for moving the merged entity forward.“We are pleased to welcome all of our team members to the combined company, and we look forward to implementing all of the strategic initiatives that will position the company for continued growth,” Reeg said.Jason Hidalgo covers business and technology for the Reno Gazette Journal, and also reviews the latest video games.

Veolia had been trying to get permission to vote, which could have resulted in moves to oust Suezs management.Suez ceded ground on some fronts, accepting that a side-agreement to spin off some of its assets into a separate entity with new shareholders would be smaller than it had hoped for, but the group said it was satisfied with the outcome and price.""We used all the levers we had to defend the interests of the company in the face of a hostile situation,"" Suez Chairman Philipp Varin told reporters.Pursuing more defensive tactics now risked becoming counter-productive, Varin said. The deal with Veolia also includes job guarantees for Suez employees for a four-year period.Varin met Frerot over the weekend to clinch the deal, a source familiar with the discussions said.Frerot and Varin said at separate news conferences that Gerard Mestrallet, who used to chair Suez and also French utility Engie, had helped broker talks between the companies.The companies said they aimed to reach a definitive merger agreement by May 14.A NEW SUEZAs part of the agreement, and in part to ease antitrust problems, some of Suezs assets will be spun off into a new entity with around 7 billion euros in revenue.Investment funds Meridiam, Ardian and Global Infrastructure Partners as well as state-backed Caisse des Depots and employees will be shareholders in the ""new Suez"". A price for that carve-out has not yet been set.That new entity will mainly comprise Suezs French water activities, but also some international assets, including in Italy, the Czech Republic, India and Australia.

Jersey Sports Zone YoutubeJain added that he plans to find a target company that wants to merge with Hometown for under $500 million, according to the Times. The target would then take Hometown over, acquiring a greater than 51 percent share.“The name changes, the ticker changes, the board changes, the management changes, everything changes as the target company enters the U.S. capital market,” Jain explained.But all that doesn’t answer the question of Hometown’s bizarre valuation of nearly $100 million despite it losing cash and doing just over $35,000 in sales over the past two years combined.When asked to comment on the suspicious trading activity that pushed the firm’s valuation to eyebrow-raising heights last year, Jain told the Times, “Maso Capital has no knowledge on the buying or selling in HWIN.”HWIN is the stock ticker that Hometown International uses.Jain noted that Maso has not traded any of its shares in the company since its initial investment.A former Securities and Exchange Commission staffer speculated to the Times that the run-up in Hometown’s valuation could be part of a long-term plan to “uplist,” or move the stock from the over-the-counter markets, in which buyers and sellers deal directly with one another, to an exchange like the NYSE or Nasdaq, which are centralized.Market capitalization is one criteria exchanges consider when deciding to list companies. Listing on an exchange would make it easier for shareholders to trade stock in the company.The Times noted, though, that Hometown faced various other barriers to finding its way to a major exchange, if that was the goal.Representatives for Maso and Hometown did not return The Post’s request for comment.The latest development comes weeks after Hometown International first drew scrutiny when hedge fund manager David Einhorn pointed out the company’s bizarre market capitalization.Einhorn used the publicly traded company, which is listed on the over-the-counter market, as a warning sign for investors in a letter to clients.Einhorn noted that the company had reached that eye-popping valuation despite reporting total sales of less than $37,000 over the past two years and was closed for nearly half of 2020 due to pandemic restrictions.“The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn wrote in April.Later that month, the management of Hometown International disavowed the company’s valuation, according to SEC filings.“Management is aware of no basis to support the company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets,” the company said in an April 30 statement."

Dreamfield has been used to coordinate fan engagement events such as discord chats and local meet-and-greet events. Warpath 850’s past events have included FSU athletes such as first-round draft pick Jermaine Johnson II of the New York Jets, Amari Gainer, Skey Ekes, Camm McDonald and Dillan Gibbons.The merger is the first consolidation between two NIL organizations focused on the same institution, said Rising Spear CEO Matthew Quigley. The addition of Dreamfield will also help Rising Spear secure relationships with enterprise-level clients by allowing corporate members to host in-person events and facilitate large-scale enterprise deals.“This exciting merger between Rising Spear and Warpath 850 will create a strong, unified membership platform to benefit Seminole student-athletes,” Quigley said. “We look forward to welcoming all Warpath 850 subscribers with a reminder that the student-athletes receive 100% of all donations collected by Rising Spear.”Corey Staniscia, Dreamfield’s director of external relations, said they had been working with Quigley since they launched the platform. He said the merger is historic.“It is the first time the industry is seeing two groups that were on parallel tracks in the same town now team up in a peaceful way to further benefit the athletes at the institution,” Staniscia said. “Dreamfield’s only goal is to produce high-quality cash value commercial opportunities to as many athletes as possible in a legal, safe, and compliant manner. We look forward to continuing to accomplish this goal in Tallahassee with Rising Spear not only for fan engagement programming but also on the enterprise side of our business.”McKenzie Milton, former FSU quarterback and Dreamfield co-founder, said the merger will boost the company’s ability to get FSU athletes more NIL deals.“We are looking forward to working with Rising Spear to implement a program that brings as many NIL-compliant deals to each one of them through Rising Spear and Dreamfield,” Milton said."

Well, it appears that the two companies are still in talks and that a potential deal may be announced in the next few weeks. First reported by Bloomberg, that news sent the American alcohol world abuzz with speculation about what the proposed agreement may look like and what impacts it may have overall.The two companies combined market value would be nearly $92 billion, and the structure of any potential deal is unknown right now. According to the latest data, both have similar market capitalizations: Constellation Brands at $44.3 billion and Monster at $43.7.CHICAGO, IL - JUNE 07: In this photo illustration, bottles of Corona beer are shown on June 7, 2013 ... [+] in Chicago, Illinois. Constellation Brands, one of the worlds largest wine companies, is expected to become the third-largest beer supplier in the United State today with a $5.3 billion purchase of the U.S. distribution rights of Grupo Modelo beers from Anheuser Busch InBev. Corona Extra, brewed by Grupo Modelo, is the number one selling imported beer sold in the United States and the number six selling beer overall. (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty ImagesEach company is a leader in its respective spaces and could benefit from the effects of cross-pollination should a deal go down. Constellation has been on quite a tear in the market as their beer brands Corona Extra and Modelo Especial continue to gain market share. Those are on top of their powerful wine and spirit catalogs filled with well-known brands like Kim Crawford and Meiomi wines and Svedka vodka and Casa Nobel tequila.Monster, one of the leaders in the lucrative and booming energy drink market, held a 39% share of the $5.7 billion US market in 2020, second only to Red Bull, would bring an attractive distribution network and a steady revenue stream to the deal.BRISTOL, TN - AUGUST 23: Kyle Busch, driver of the #54 Monster Energy Toyota, celebrates with a ... [+] burnout after winning during the NASCAR Nationwide Series Food City 250 at Bristol Motor Speedway on August 23, 2013 in Bristol, Tennessee. (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images) Getty ImagesOne of the more interesting parts of a potential pairing would be the merging of two beverage industry segments that previously stayed on opposite sides of the fence. Well, until Monster jumped over it in January. It could lead to seeing the same delivery vehicles dropping off energy drinks and cases of beer. If they could pull it off, you might see the more significant players- Coca-Cola, Pepsi, AB Inbev, and Molson Coors- becoming more active in searching for new opportunities. While all of the above have worked on partnership products recently, each has stayed out of the others space.Another twist could be the possibility of beverages on the market that mix caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis in different forms. That would be because Constellation has an almost 40% stake in Canopy Growth Corp, a Canadian cannabis company that sells THC-infused drinks across Canada. That could be a sticking point for one of Monsters largest shareholders, Coca-Cola, with an almost 20% share of the company, and holders of a distribution agreement with Monster.As for what form a possible deal could take, there are several possibilities. It could be as equals or one or the other executing a complete acquisition. A team of RBC Capital Market analysts led by Nik Modi sees the first possibility as the most plausible.“We view this as the most likely scenario if a deal were to go through, considering the similar market capitalization of the two companies (Monster at ~$43 billion and Constellation at ~$44 billion), he says. “A merger would create a total beverage company with over $14 billion in sales and over $5 billion in EBITDA.”Analyst Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets RBC CaptialIf Monster decided to acquire Constellation, it would face a couple of possibly significant roadblocks. According to Modi, the first would be that the co-CEOs of the Monster, Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, are 71 and 68, respectively, and might not have the ""appetite to go through a large-scale acquisition. The second would be the possibility of little interest in getting into the wine and alcohol business.“We believe Monster could be less interested in Constellation’s wine & spirits business vs. the beer business in a hypothetical acquisition, given potentially lower synergies in wine and a lower topline growth profile of the business,"" said Modi.That could lead to Monster selling off the parts of the Constellation portfolio that they dont need, bringing in some quick revenue.According to RBC, the possibility of Constellation acquiring Monster seems the least plausible due to poor profitability and synergies.One last scenario that could play out would be a partnership between the two, with the possibility of Coca-Cola entering in too. It would “allow both companies to expand their occasion and category exposure, as well as offering international distribution expansion opportunities.”All of this is also playing out on a landscape that just recently received a Treasury Department report that decried the continuing trend of acquisitions in the alcohol space and loss of competition between players. Any merger of this size would have to undergo government scrutiny and win approval.It seems that all of the whispers and behind closed doors discussions will be answered soon, and there quite possibly could be another seismic shift in the beverage world. One that could easily be just the first domino to fall in a long line of moves over the next year."

Sues to Block $13 Billion Deal by UnitedHealth Group,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block a $13 billion acquisition of a health technology company by a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, in the latest move by the Biden administration to clamp down on corporate consolidation.The agency argued that a deal by UnitedHealth to buy the health tech firm Change Healthcare would give UnitedHealth sensitive data that it could wield against its competitors in the insurance business. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. New York and Minnesota also joined the lawsuit.A spokeswoman for Optum, the UnitedHealth subsidiary, said in a statement that the Justice Department’s “deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the health care system,” and added that the company would “defend our case vigorously.” A spokeswoman for Change Healthcare said it was still “working toward closing the merger as we comply with our obligations under the merger agreement.”"

It was “besieged with criticism over its governance, business model, and ability to turn a profit”, MSN reported citing a Wall Street Journal article.The company lost over US$2 billion in 2018, and in September 2019, following mounting pressure from investors based on disclosures WeWork had made in its S-1 filing for the IPO, co-founder Adam Neumann resigned from his position as CEO and gave up his majority voting control.When WeWork formally withdrew its S-1 filing and announced its IPO postponement, its reported public valuation was around US$10 billion, a drastic reduction from the US$47 billion valuation it achieved in January 2019 and less than the US$12.8 billion it had raised since 2010.“WeWork has spent the past year transforming the business and refocusing its core, while simultaneously managing and innovating through a historic downturn,” said Sandeep Mathrani, WeWork CEO. “As a result, WeWork has emerged as the global leader in flexible space with a value proposition that is stronger than ever.”Mathrani and Executive Chair Marcelo Claure will stay on to lead WeWork, along with the rest of the company’s leadership team. Following the public listing, Vivek Ranadivé of BowX and Deven Parekh of Insight Partners will join WeWork’s Board of Directors.“I’m thrilled to partner with Sandeep, Marcelo and the entire WeWork team as they continue to transform this business and the real estate industry at large,” said Ranadivé, who is Chair and Co-CEO of BowX.“This company is primed to achieve profitability in the short-term, but the added long-term opportunity for growth and innovation is what made WeWork a perfect fit for BowX. With a fantastic core business, I see WeWork as a company at an inflection point, with an incredible roster of key members coupled with the vision and leadership to digitise an enormous industry.”WeWork under Mathrani has shut 106 office locations yet still has 851 locations in 152 cities totalling more than one million workstations. Enterprise companies now make up more than 50 per cent of WeWork’s memberships, up from just 10 per cent in 2015. WeWork reported US$3.2 billion in revenue last year – the same as in 2019.WeWork is backed by Japanese investment giant SoftBank.BowX, a special purpose acquisition company, is a shell firm that uses proceeds from a public listing to buy a private firm. The firm, led by the owner of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and affiliated with basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal, raised US$420 million when it started trading shares last August. Its shares rose more than seven per cent following the announcement.BowX will be joined by private investors including Starwood, Fidelity and Centaurus, who have committed about US$800 million in total to the transaction."

What it means for customers,"Price Chopper/Market 32 and Tops Markets announced Monday they have entered a merger deal, bringing together two of upstate New Yorks largest supermarket chains.The companies said the agreement would join the two independent grocery chains and double their footprint in the Northeast. They collectively have about 30,000 full and part-time workers.The news comes amid a changing and fiercely competitive landscape in the industry, which has taken its toll on both companies, and as stores grapple with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted supply chains and forced new safety measures.“This merger marks a major step forward and collectively elevates our ability to compete on every level,” Scott Grimmett, the new companys CEO, said in a statement.Price Chopper, based in Schenectady and founded in 1932 by the Golub family, has 130 stores across the Northeast and 18,000 employees.In New York, the stores are located through central New York, the Albany area and the Hudson Valley. They also have stores in Scranton area in Pennsylvania and into Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.Top Markets, based in Williamsville in Erie County, has 162 grocery stores in New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont, and 14,000 workers.The companies said it expects no immediate changes to its operations.""It is business as usual,"" spokeswoman Kathy Sautter said in an email.""We’re excited about what this merger means for our associates, customers and communities. Together we will be even better able to provide an exceptional shopping experience while continuing to give back to our communities.""The Price Chopper/Market 32 and Tops businesses will retain main offices in Schenectady and Williamsville, and the two will continue to be managed locally, the companies said in a news release.While Grimmett will head the new company out of Schenectady, Tops chairman Frank Curci will serve on the Board of Directors of the new parent company and as a consultant during the transition.“We have long believed that this merger makes sense both strategically and based on the similar ways in which we each put customers first, go to market and treat our people,” Curci said in a statement.The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.The stores have little overlap: Price Chopper doesnt extend into western New York, where Tops is based, and Tops doesnt have as large a footprint as Price Chopper in the eastern side of the state.But company executives said they expect strong synergy between their brands that will aid the stores future.The companies will continue to operate in the near term under their current names, Grimmett told the Times Union in Albany, and he said layoffs are unexpected.He said the stores will hiring due to the demand for supplies and food amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“I’ve seen tremendous change in our industry across my 65-year career and have long been an advocate for the promise of innovation and partnership, like that which has driven this merger forward,” said Neil Golub, Price Chopper/Market 32’s executive chairman.“I can assure you that our commitment to sustaining and improving the communities in which we operate remains steadfast.”Jonathan Pasternak, a corporate finance attorney at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron in Manhattan, said the merger is not uncommon in the volatile industry, and he noted the bankruptcies that some chains faced, such as A&P in 2015.""They are probably trying to avoid both of them going under,"" he said.As one company, they can expand their buying power and find economies of scale that can better compete with Trader Joes and retail stores like Walmart and Target that have been aggressive in the grocery business, he said.""They’ve got a margin problem, and they have a competition problem,"" Pasternak said.More:How grocers and shoppers are prepping for a second COVID waveJoseph Spector is the Government and Politics Editor for the USA TODAY Networks Atlantic Group, overseeing coverage in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware.

merger,https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/whiting-oasis-merger-whoasis-will-double-new-companys-size-without-adding-any-new-debt/article_20847456-9f1c-11ec-873b-37a476d48e48.html,Why the Aetna and CVS Merger Is So Dangerous,"This week, the Justice Department blessed a $69 billion merger between pharmacy chain CVS and insurance giant Aetna. CVS also owns Caremark, one of the three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which negotiate drug discounts on behalf of health plans. With another tie-up between a PBM and an insurance company—Express Scripts and Cigna—awaiting likely approval, this signals an almost formal merger between the PBM industry and the health-insurance industry.When the CVS/Aetna merger was proposed, I wrote at the Prospect that this vertical combination would be incredibly dangerous. If CVS/Aetna knows the prescription drug usages, methods of delivery, and pricing data for all of its rivals, who all have patients who order prescriptions from CVS pharmacies, it can exploit that data advantage to skim off the top of every side of the pharmaceutical market.But a funny thing happened on the way to the deal closing. Congress, state legislatures, and even the Trump administration have cracked down on PBM profits in numerous ways, making CVSs ownership of a market leader in that industry far less lucrative. Does that make the combination of CVSs and Aetnas assets less harmful to consumers, health plan competitors, and pharmacies? Absolutely not. In fact, the need to compensate for that lost profit center makes it more likely that CVS/Aetna will employ market power.This merger should absolutely not have been approved.The multi-sided hits on PBMs are a result of the pharmaceutical industry using PBMs as a foil to deflect from their own price-gouging. But that doesnt mean PBMs exploitation isnt consequential. Acting as hidden monopolies, PBMs skim as much as one in five dollars out of every prescription drug purchase, harming pharmacies, health plans, and consumers alike. They accomplish this by being the only player in the drug supply chain with perfect information about what everyone else pays. They pocket secret rebates from drug companies, overcharge health plans for drugs while undercutting reimbursements to pharmacies, and use punishing fees and claw-backs to recoup money even after the transaction is made.But this gravy train is coming to an end. This week, President Trump signed two bills ending PBMs’ abhorrent “gag order” practices, whereby they would contractually bar pharmacists from informing patients of the lowest price for their drugs. Often paying out of network in cash is cheaper than using the prescription drug plan, but PBMs wanted to keep that secret, because they don’t take the spread on an out-of-network payment.State legislatures have also gotten into the act. In California, AB 315, signed by Governor Jerry Brown in late September, licenses PBMs; requires them to disclose all data regarding drug costs, rebates, and fees; and mandates that they act as fiduciaries, in the best interest of their health plan clients. If this model legislation is taken up nationwide, it would severely limit PBM skimming.Arkansas signed a licensing law as well in March, with monitoring of industry reimbursement practices. And Ohio’s Medicaid program fired its PBMs—OptumRx and CVS Caremark—and moved the business to companies with a transparent pricing model.The most surprising moves against PBMs came from the Trump administration. In February, Trumps Council of Economic Advisers effectively called for a breakup of the industry. Then in July, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed to eliminate the industry’s “safe harbor” for negotiating drug company rebates. This provision has protected PBMs from anti-kickback statutes, which prevent any company from paying off another to increase its business. Without the safe harbor, PBMs could not negotiate a rebate with a drug company, and then make that drug available to its customers, without violating the law.The cumulative impact of all this should significantly cut PBM profits, including that of CVS Caremark. Over 70 percent of CVSs net revenues in its most recent quarter came from its “pharmacy services” segment, which includes its PBM. But the company will inevitably seek to make up that shortfall somewhere. And the combining with Aetna provides exactly that opportunity.The merged company can now segregate Aetnas 22 million insurance subscribers, so they can only get primary care treatment and medications at their own pharmacies. For example, at CVS “Minute Clinics,” practitioners treat minor illnesses and injuries, administer vaccinations and injections, and give physicals. And CVS can also offer lower drug prices in its “preferred pharmacy network,” or even grant exclusivity to its locations so Aetna customers can only access drugs at their local CVS.This would obviously degrade competing pharmacies, who have already felt the pressure. Independent pharmacies contended in January that CVS Caremark had slashed reimbursements for numerous prescription drugs. At the same time, CVS was sending these pharmacists inquiry letters about buying their stores. This “squeeze and buy” gambit did not lead to any government enforcement, but you can see how further steering of Aetna subscribers would lead to even fewer choices for pharmacies.Moreover, CVS/Aetna will still acquire all that pricing data on its rivals by virtue of owning a large pharmacy chain, information that can be put to use even in an environment where PBMs are on a leash. Aetna subscribers in remote areas or just far from a CVS could get pushed into CVSs new next-day drug delivery service, and mail-order drug schemes have been criticized for creating substantial wasted prescriptions and for pocketing the extra cash.If Aetna and CVS had incentive to use their market power to crush rivals before, they really have it now, after state and federal governments hollowed out one of CVSs main profit centers.Of course, the antitrust authorities simply dont think in these terms. They look solely at “consumer welfare” in determining whether to improve a merger. CVS Minute Clinics could be a cheaper option for routine care, and the chronically ill could benefit from the combination. “Vertical” deals between complementary companies in the same sector dont cause much concern for antitrust enforcers or especially the courts: Just ask AT&T/Time Warner.The Justice Department did force the divestiture of Aetnas Medicare Part D drug plan business, because CVS sells one already. But they ignored the impact of a more concentrated overall health sector, not just on costs but on the systems fragility, innovation, and patient access. They enabled a health behemoth to grow in every community in America, giving it the wherewithal and the motive to put that dominance to work at the expense of practically everyone. It was a terrible mistake."
