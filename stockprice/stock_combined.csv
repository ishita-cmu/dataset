Stock Price,https://www.fastcompany.com/90598238/gamestop-stock-surge-blockbuster,GameStop’s wild stock surge won’t stop it from being the next Blockbuster,"advertisementadvertisementThe inexorable shift from packaged video games to downloads is bad news for retail kingpin GameStop, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at the company’s stock price right now. Shares of the video game retailer climbed as high as $247 in after-hours trading on Tuesday, up from around $18 per share just a couple of weeks ago. The spike is almost entirely due to a game of brinksmanship between Wall Street firms and individual investors, egged on through forum posters on Reddit. But when the dust settles on this whirlwind of stock market drama, it’ll almost certainly have no bearing on GameStop’s actual business. Experts say that no matter where GameStop’s stock price ends up, it’ll ultimately remain a struggling seller of packaged video games whose turnaround plan looks like a long shot. That’s what makes this whole episode so bizarre to begin with. (GameStop did not respond to a request for comment.)advertisementadvertisement“Nothing that GameStop has done warrants this,” says Michael Futter, a game industry analyst and founder of the consulting firm F-Squared. A BASIS FOR GROWTH GameStop’s initial surge wasn’t entirely unmoored from reality. Until earlier this month, the stock had been enjoying modest growth thanks to some small recent successes. In October, for instance, GameStop announced that it would use Microsoft’s cloud products for retail services such as inventory management and checkout, and would equip its employees with Surface tablets. As part of that deal, Microsoft agreed to share digital game revenues for any consoles sold through GameStop’s stores.advertisementGameStop has also been cutting costs by closing some stores, and its recent sales have benefitted from the launch of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles in the fall. Although holiday 2020 revenues were down 3.1%, comparable store sales increased 4.8%. The coronavirus pandemic also accelerated GameStop’s shift to e-commerce, with online sales growing 309% during the holiday period. “What this communicates to investors is that GameStop can pivot from retail in times where it needs to, because stores are closed or hard to access because of the pandemic,” Futter says. On January 11, GameStop announced that it was adding Ryan Cohen, the cofounder and former CEO of pet food website Chewy, to its board of directors along with two other former Chewy executives. As Slate’s Alex Kirschner reports, Cohen had bought a 13% stake in GameStop last August, and his investment firm, RC Ventures, had previously criticized GameStop for moving too slowly into digital sales and mobile gaming. GameStop’s stock rose to around $39 a few days after Cohen’s appointment.advertisementAlthough some day traders on Reddit began murmuring last fall about GameStop’s stock being undervalued, Futter says the company’s increasing stock price—from around $10 per share in October—wasn’t unusual. “You can see this steady rise, and there are these beats in the story where it makes sense,” he says. “GameStop has done something, GameStop has reported something, the stock goes up. This is natural.” INFLECTION POINT Still, Cohen’s appointment may have been a triggering event, sending GameStop’s previously natural growth into overdrive.advertisementLast week, a wave of investors, most notably Andrew Left of Citron Research, began pushing for more investors to short the stock, figuring that it was overvalued. That is, they would borrow shares from existing investors and sell them into the market at high prices, figuring they could buy those shares back at lower prices later and return them to investors at the original price, pocketing the difference. That’s when individual investors on sites like Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum fought back, buying up shares to send stock prices even higher. The result was panic among some short sellers, some of whom were forced to cut their losses and buy back their stocks at even higher prices, allowing them to be returned to the original investors. That demand just sent GameStop’s stocks soaring even higher. (A Tuesday evening tweet by Elon Musk on the whole brouhaha further contributed to the surge.) Futter says it’s all essentially a case of “financial trolling,” one that’s become detached from any of GameStop’s actual business prospects.advertisement“This doesn’t reflect at all on GameStop as a company,” he says. “It doesn’t reflect on their health; it doesn’t reflect on their plan to recover and adapt to a changing market. This is about Reddit day traders driving the price of the stock up, squeezing out short sellers who also don’t have much interest in GameStop other than thinking it was failing.” PICKING UP THE PIECES Futter expects to see a reckoning for GameStop’s stock eventually, perhaps after the company’s next earnings report comes out in March. (GameStop’s fiscal year ends on February 1, which itself may be contributing the current sense of urgency among traders who need to return borrowed shares.) “There is a gap right now between what GameStop is actually worth and what that share price is,” he says. “The bubble’s going to pop at some point.”advertisementWhen that happens, GameStop will likely be back to business as usual, trying to craft a turnaround strategy that involves less dependence on selling physical game discs. It’s just too easy to buy games digitally through the consoles.” Lewis Ward, IDC Lewis Ward, an industry analyst for International Data Corporation (IDC) notes that physical game sales made up about 60% of total game revenues in 2016, and have since fallen to 29% of revenues in 2020. While overall physical game revenue increased in that time span—from $4.83 billion to $5.37 billion—he believes that growth is almost entirely because of Nintendo’s rebound from the disappointing Wii U console with the Switch , not because of any broader industry trends. IDC forecasts that physical game sales will decline to $3.46 billion by 2024. All of which explains why GameStop has been touting a “reboot” that involves closing down some stores, reinventing others as social and cultural hubs, overhauling its online shopping experience, and partnering with vendors on exclusive products.advertisementBut some experts—or at least those that aren’t investing or short selling the stock—say they haven’t seen anything from GameStop yet that would fundamentally transform the business. “I’m skeptical,” Ward says. “It’s just too easy to buy games digitally through the consoles. I don’t see what they can do that’s going to drive a bunch of new revenue.” Console makers sell games as downloads directly to consumers, cutting third parties such as GameStop out of the picture. Futter also notes that while GameStop has talked about turning its stores into cultural destinations, those plans will obviously be on hold during the coronavirus pandemic. And even if GameStop can reinvent its stores as hang-out spots, it’s unclear whether people would buy more games in the process. Much of what GameStop is doing still seems experimental, such as opening an esports event center in Texas, rather than clearly disruptive. And besides, Futter says, it’s a little too late to be diversifying the business away from physical sales.advertisement“They had an entire [console] generation to get it right, and they didn’t, so all of this is survival,” he says. “This is about righting the ship, not about doing anything innovative.” None of that really matters to the Redditors claiming to get rich or the hedge funds that could get crushed in the process. For them, GameStop will be best known not as a place to hang out and play games, but as fodder for a different game entirely."

REUTERS/Matthew Childs/File PhotoNov 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) chief Elon Musks Twitter poll proposing to sell a tenth of his holdings in the electric carmaker shaved around $60 billion off the companys market value on Monday and raised questions about whether he may have violated his settlement with the U.S. securities regulator again.Musk, the worlds richest person with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $304 billion on Monday, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stake if users of the social media network approved. The poll garnered more than 3.5 million votes, and 57.9% of the people voted in favor. read moreMusks poll follows a proposal by U.S. Senate Democrats to tax stocks of billionaires to help finance President Joe Bidens social spending plan and fill a loophole that allowed the rich to indefinitely defer capital gains taxes.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterTeslas shares were last down 4.8% at $1,162.94 after falling as low as $1,133 earlier in the session. Tesla accounted for over 10% of all trading in U.S. companies stocks, according to Refinitiv data.""Elon Musk doesnt like to do things in a conventional way,"" said Russ Mould, director at AJ Bell Investment. ""Holding a poll on Twitter about whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla might seem crazy, but one could say it is normal behavior for him.""Musk had previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.""I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,"" Musk wrote along with his poll. ""I was prepared to accept either outcome.""However, Musks tweet renews questions about whether he is in compliance with a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that requires material tweets about the company to be vetted by a lawyer. The SEC, which declined to comment, found Musk violated that agreement in 2019 and tightened it.Tesla was not immediately available for comment.Philip Moustakis, a former SEC enforcement attorney and counsel at Seward and Kissel LLP in New York, said if Musk had failed to get the tweet cleared then it may have violated the settlement. But if the SEC took action, Musk would have a ""good argument"" if his tweet protected shareholders by cushioning a decline in the stock price.“Maybe by making this mini circus out of it Elon actually softened the impact on the share price because he provided an explanation to the public as to why he is selling,"" said Moustakis.The billionaire, known for his Twitter banter and lively interactions with followers, was fined $20 million by the SEC for tweets in 2018 and required to step down as chairman.With his almost cult-like following, Musk has considerable power to move Teslas stock with his comments, but murky rules make it difficult for regulators to rein him in, Reuters reported in May. read moreLast month, Tesla became the fifth company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization, joining Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O).Investors will be closely watching SEC filings from Tesla for any details on Musks plans. SEC rules give companies four working days to report major events.TOUGH TO BET AGAINSTMarket participants expected speculators would try to front-run Musks selling. Including stock options, Musk owns a 23% stake in the worlds most valuable car company, with about 170.5 million shares as of June 30.Still, Tesla is a tough company to bet against.

Wall Street, however, has a different story to tell.An IPO frenzy is ripping through the financial sector, which has seen more companies go public this year than any since the dotcom bubble of the late-1990s.""The market for IPOs is red hot, so they are striking while that iron is hot,"" said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst from Atmosphere Research Group.Another consideration: employees have company stock that expires this year. If Airbnb continued to resist calls for it to go public, employees could have lost their chance to cash out. That, Harteveldt said, was a major issue for Airbnb.""So they just concluded: Better to go out now,"" Harteveldt said.So far at least, it appears to be a well-placed bet.Airbnbs stocks were offered at $68 per share on Wednesday, but when it started trading on the public market Thursday under the ticker symbol ""ABNB,"" it smashed through that price, climbing to around $144 a share.That brought the companys value to $100 billion, or more than the combined worth of hotel chains Hilton, Marriott and Intercontinental.Instead of ringing the bell on the floor of the Nasdaq, Airbnb released a slick video of hosts around the world ding-donging their doorbells.""You gave us hope that the idea of strangers staying together, in each others homes, was not so crazy after all,"" Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky said in the video. ""Airbnb is rooted in the fundamental idea that people are good and were in this together,"" said Chesky, whose stake in the company tops $11 billion.Airbnbs IPO comes just one day after food delivery app DoorDash went public, soaring 85% in its stock market debut.An 80% revenue drop in two weeksAirbnbs comeback story is remarkable. When the pandemic first struck, Airbnbs business crashed. The numbers painted a troubling picture: the company was logging more cancellations than new bookings.""Revenues dropped 80% in the span of two weeks. And the most difficult thing was, we didnt know how long it was going to last,"" Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk told NPR in an interview on Thursday. ""But fast-forward to summer, folks were eager to get outside of their home.""Airbnb laid off 1,900 employees, took out billions of dollars in loans, offered hosts deep-cleaning guidance and retooled its website to promote beachfront getaways and cabins tucked away in the woods that were close by.""So, oftentimes this just meant getting in a car and driving to a rural area,"" Blecharczyk said. ""They like the idea of having a home all to themselves where they can be in their own bubble and have their own kitchen and prepare their own food.""The moves fueled a rebound. Airbnb bookings have not fully recovered, although the company is performing much better than most hotel chains.The company managed to turn a profit during the third quarter of this year, but it still has never been able to make a full year profitable — and does not know if it will ever.""We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve profitability,"" Airbnb wrote in its IPO filing.Airbnbs pandemic support of hosts: Enough, or a little pittance?Take Louis Koorndyk, a retired Post Office worker who has two properties outside of Las Vegas he uses as Airbnb rentals.""Were getting bookings much closer to home. People arent necessarily flying in, especially people like to do more of a staycation,"" said Koorndyk, who also co-leads the Greater Las Vegas Short Term Rentals Association.Koorndyk said guests requested the ability to work remotely from their staycation. He is advertising pandemic-era pads, after all.""I had to really upgrade my WiFi and provide 20 feet of Ethernet cable for people doing Zoom meetings,"" he said.Koorndyk has seen bookings rise about 50% since hitting bottom. He feels grateful for even the meager support provided by Airbnb, which cannot be said of all hosts.""Theyre really good at saying, we got your backs, were going to take care of you. Were partners in all of this. But from a lot of hosts point of view, thats never been true, and its never been less true than today,"" said Michigan lawyer Enrico Schaefer, who is representing an Airbnb host in a class-action lawsuit claiming the company has ripped off hosts during the pandemic.Indeed, Airbnb is nothing without its 4 million hosts around the world. And many were infuriated when the company surprised them by overriding hosts cancellation policies and fully refunding guest $1 billion worth of bookings.Airbnb responded by setting up a $250 million fund for hosts, yet complaints persisted over reimbursement amounts that some said were inconsistent, or representing a tiny fraction of what they would typically receive from a cancellation.""Some hosts got a little pittance back. Most hosts did not. And it was only for a very short period of time,"" Schaefer said.Airbnb says it knows its fate could hinge on the happiness of its hosts. The company has made shares available to select U.S. hosts who have been active the past two years and launched a host endowment to invest in areas to directly benefit hosts.In its IPO paperwork, Airbnb noted other future threats to the companys future prosperity, including local laws and regulations that could curb the supply of short-term rentals. In addition, the company cautioned that an uptick in listings from professional management companies could ""negatively impact"" the ""uniqueness"" of listings.Analyst Harteveldt said some of the companys problems could collide: increased corporate ownership of Airbnbs running up against community resistance.""Cities dont want to see apartment buildings become pseudo-hotels. They dont want to see housing stock snapped up by investors and turned around and rented on Airbnb,"" he said. ""Thats going to be a real challenge for Airbnb."""

Musk has since agreed to submit his public statements about Teslas finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel. The agreement came after Musks famous tweet in August 2018 saying he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 per share and that he had secured the funding to do so.

Stock Price,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0711/the-highest-priced-stocks-in-america.aspx,Top 5 Highest Priced Stocks in America,"Some of the most sought-after stocks are those that come with a hefty price tag and many of us equate value with price. The higher the price, the more valuable and, therefore, the more desirable a company becomes. The average investor may not be able to afford a single share of stock from the following companies.Retail investors need to know which stocks may be difficult to trade because of their high per-share price. Its also worth noting that not all brokers offer their clients the option to purchase fractional shares.A companys market capitalization is a product of both its share price and the total number of outstanding shares and a companys stock price doesnt necessarily tell you whether a company is over or undervalued.Heres a list of the top five highest-priced stocks that trade in the U.S., as of July 2022. This list excludes those sold only on over-the-counter (OTC) markets.Key Takeaways A companys market capitalization is the product of its share price and the number of outstanding shares.The stock price doesnt necessarily reflect the overall value of the company.Some companies have very few shares available, which may translate to a higher price per share in the market.Investors should analyze a companys value and share price using fundamentals.1. Berkshire HathawayStock price: $421,800.00Market capitalization: $619.9 billionBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has the highest-priced shares of any U.S. company, and is also one of the largest companies in the world, consistently ranking in the top 10 by market value.Berkshire was originally a textile company, but was bought by Warren Buffett and is now a holding company for his investments. Among its many holdings are the GEICO insurance company, the BNSF Railway, and the Lubrizol chemical company.Buffett famously resisted splitting Berkshires shares, something companies normally do to make it easier to trade their stock. As the companys chief executive officer (CEO), he kept the price high to make it harder to trade and to discourage short-term trading which would increase the stocks volatility.The company launched a new share class in 1996 (BRK.B), which has a lower price. This allows people to purchase much smaller chunks of the company. They trade for a much more accessible $280.83 in 2022.2. NVRStock price: $4,370.80Market capitalization: $14.38 billionNVR (NVR) is a homebuilding and mortgage banking company based in Virginia. The company reaches consumers in 34 cities in 14 states, including Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, Delaware, West Virginia, and New Jersey, as well as D.C.The homebuilding operations build and sell homes. This division has three different brands, which are Ryan Homes, NVHomes, and Heartland Homes. NVRs building products division supports the homebuilding unit by providing and delivering building supplies.The company has two different units under its mortgage banking division. NVR Mortgage offers services to homebuyers while NVR Settlement Services provides settlement and title transactions for its homebuilding unit.Just like Berkshire Hathaway, NVR hasnt split its stock.A stock split increases the number of outstanding shares by issuing more to existing shareholders. Once the split is completed, the stocks price is reduced.3. SeaboardStock price: $3,750.01Market capitalization: $4.35 billionSeaboard (SEB) is a multinational corporation that deals in grains and agriculture products, including pork, sugar, and alcohol. The company also deals in commodity trading and milling.It built itself up through a series of acquisitions, including its first one in 1918 when it acquired its first flour mill in Kansas. It merged with Hathaway Industries in 1959 and became a public company. Thats when it changed its name to Seaboard Allied Milling Corporation.Based in Kansas, Seaboard now operates in offices across the world through a series of subsidiaries and non-controlled, non-consolidated affiliates.4. AlphabetStock Price: $2,403.37Market Capitalization: $1.58 trillionAlphabet (GOOG) was founded in 1998 as the search engine company, Google, and became the worlds most popular search engine. After a reorganization in 2015, it changed its name to Alphabet and created a brand new holding company.A great deal of Alphabets revenue is derived from various forms of advertising, including performance and brand advertising. The remainder is derived from app sales, in-app purchases, hardware, as well as fees from licensing and services from the Google search engine, YouTube, Google Play, Google Cloud, Chrome browser, and its Android mobile operating system.5. AutoZone• Stock Price: $2,182.37• Market capitalization: $42.53 billionAutoZone Inc. (AZO) retails and distributes automotive replacement parts and accessories. The company provides a sales program that offers commercial credit and delivery of parts and other products and sells automotive diagnostic and repair software under the ALLDATA brand.As of May 7, 2022, AutoZone operated 6,115 stores in the United States, 673 stores in Mexico, and 58 stores in Brazil. The company was founded in 1979 and is based in Memphis, Tennessee.Is the Price of a Company’s Stocks Indicative of That Company’s Value? A companys stock price simply represents the current price at which a buyer and seller are willing to trade its stock. Therefore, the stock price alone doesnt paint an accurate picture of its overall value. The stock price is a proportional value of a companys value as it signifies a percentage change in its market cap.What Is the Most Expensive Stock in the World? Berkshire Hathaway is the worlds most expensive stock. One of the main reasons why the companys stock is so expensive is because it never went through a stock split. The companys CEO, Warren Buffet, deliberately decided against a split to prevent short-term trading which would lead to higher volatility.What Is the Largest Gain a Stock Has Ever Made in One Day? Volkswagen stock made the largest gain in a single day in October 2008 after an announcement made by automaker Porsche. The German carmakers stock spiked more than 93% on October 28 after Porsche said it had a 74.1% stake in the company, which was acquired via derivatives trading.Why Is Berkshire Hathaway Stock So Expensive? Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet decided against a stock split, which is why the companys shares are so expensive. He felt that this would bring value to the company by preventing high-frequency trading, thereby reducing short-term volatility in the stock. The company created a new class of shares under the ticker symbol BRK.B in 1996. These shares are more accessible and affordable for the average investor.The Bottom LineThe stock prices of certain companies may make investing in them virtually impossible for the average investor. Berkshire Hathaway never split its Class A shares because it wanted to keep value without increasing volatility, resulting in a share price that is well over $400,000.Price is not a definitive indicator of value and future growth. While true for some, it may not be the case for all company stocks. Some companies only issue a low number of shares, which means a higher market price. Be sure to look at the entire picture, including business models, product offerings, and earnings when thinking of investing."

David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon announced its first stock split since the dot-com boom, telling investors on Wednesday that theyll receive 20 shares for each share they currently own. The stock soared 6% in extended trading. The company also said the board authorized it to buy back up to $10 billion worth of shares. Stock splits are cosmetic and do not fundamentally change anything about the company, other than possibly making the shares accessible to a larger number of investors because of their cheaper price.Were the split to happen as of Wednesdays close, the cost of each share would go from $2,785.58 to $139.28, and each existing holder would get 19 additional shares for every one they own. Amazon is the latest highly valued tech company to pull down the price of each share through a split. Google parent Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 split in February. In mid-2020, Apple disclosed plans for a 4-for-1 split, and Tesla told investors it was instituting a 5-for-1 split. Andy Jassy, Amazons CEO, has faced a rough start to his tenure, which began in July. The stock was the worst performer among Big Tech companies last year and has dropped 16% so far in 2022, joining a decline across the sector. Amazon just reported its slowest rate of growth for any quarter since 2001 and, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report, billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb, whos been adding to his Amazon holdings, told investors on a private call that he sees about $1 trillion in untapped value at the company.Amazon, which has recently made adjustments to its compensation strategy, said the latest change is targeted at helping corporate staffers. ""This split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. Last month, Amazon boosted its maximum base salary for corporate workers to $350,000, up from $160,000, as it contends with an increasingly competitive labor market. Historically, Amazon has relied on generous stock awards to attract talent, but the shares underperformed in 2021, and employees have pressured the company to make changes.Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Amazon shares since last split in 1999 CNBC"

The companys stock began trading at $16.65 per share, up about 19% from the companys offering price of $14 per share, bringing its market cap to nearly $80 billion. It closed at $14.14 apiece, with a market cap of about $67.8 billion. Didi was most recently valued at $62 billion following an August fundraising round, according to PitchBook data. The valuation as of Wednesdays first trade is more muted than the $100 billion that some had predicted. Still, it ranks among the largest U.S. IPOs over the past decade. Didi closing in the green bucks the trend of rideshare giants closing below their first trade price. The companys American counterparts, Uber and Lyft, both closed below the initial trade in their 2019 debuts. Lyft began trading at $87.24 and closed the day at $78.29, while Uber opened at $42 apiece and dipped to $41.57. Didis listing on the New York Stock Exchange comes as demand for ride-hailing services shoots back up in tandem with falling Covid-19 cases and a roll out of vaccines. Uber and Lyft also have both said theyll be profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of this year, thanks to the recovery.The offering also represents a financial win for Uber, which owns 12.8% of the shares in Didi after it acquired Ubers China business. SoftBanks Vision Fund holds 21.5%. Apple also invested $1 billion in Didi in 2016. Didi reported a comprehensive loss of $2.54 billion on $21.63 billion in revenue last year, but turned a slight profit of $95 million on revenue of $6.44 billion in the first quarter of 2021. (Some of the companys profitability in Q1 can be credited to gains on investments of $1.9 billion related to spin-offs and divestments.) In comparison, Uber lost $6.77 billion on $11.14 billion in revenue last year, and lost $108 million on revenues of $2.90 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Between 2019 and 2020, Didis revenue shrunk almost 10% as the Covid pandemic struck China hard last year. However, prior to the pandemic, revenue grew 11% between 2018 and 2019. Additionally, revenue has bounced back in the first quarter as the pandemic recovery is in full swing, with 107% growth in Q1 from the previous years quarter."

The company even rebranded from Facebook to Meta to indicate this shift, although it was curiously timed when there was wider media coverage of Facebooks alleged failings to protect childrens mental health and allegations that its algorithims had led to greater divisiveness and discord.Mark Zuckerberg announced to the world late last year that he was planning to move his company towards the metaverse and that this would mean higher spending. But recently, Metas stock price has fallen dramatically and the tech founder has become a little less vocal about these plans.Related: The Dystopian Origins And Future Of the Metaverse, ExplainedTHEGAMER VIDEO OF THE DAYZuckerberg has committed billions every year to building technology, in software and hardware, that can bring to fruition the metaverse, a concept that he is banking on for the future. But its proving very costly. As The Verge reported, during the companys earnings call for the first quarter, Zuckerberg announced that Meta is to ""slow the pace of some of our investments"" because of ""current business growth levels"".via: techcentral.co.zaInvestors have been alarmed. Metas stock price has dropped almost 50 percent, meaning the past five years of growth has been wiped out, since it rebranded from its original name last October. At the same time that it announced that it was changing its name from Facebook, Zuckerberg revealed he was spending $10 billion a year on a new division dedicated to building out the metaverse, a department known as Reality Labs.Reality Labs is responsible for the Quest VR headset and the development of AR glasses. Its a richly endowed division, since its known that it lost nearly $3 billion just in the last quarter. It also employs around 17,000 people. To put that into perspective, this sole division is almost certainly bigger than every large games publisher on the planet.Its an incredibly expensive invesment since the payoff looks to be still years away, if it ever comes at all of course. But this is not the whole story. Meta is facing a host of issues. These include the slowest growth its seen in its history as younger people pivot to flashier and newer services such as TikTok or are simply just abandoning the crusty ""old"" platform. Meanwhile, Apples changes to ad tracking have made a severe dent in its revenue, costing Meta more than $10 billion in lost income.Meta is looking to adopt the success TikTok has enjoyed with a similar product known as Reels, which is found on Instagram, the photo-sharing app the company bought in 2012. It is also readying a mixed reality headset codenamed Cambria for launch later this year. Developing, marketing, and launching such hardware can be incredibly costly so this will eat into Metas profits.Meta will have to weather the changing moods of many people around the world as it assuredly moves from hot young social media platform to something thats more like furniture. Meanwhile, the Internet is a fast-moving landscape and while Facebook is far larger than its predecessors ever were (MySpace, Bebo) itll have to contend with changing fashions as any social media company has to.Next: The Isle Of Bigsnax Review - A Side Dish Of Vegetables"

Zillow entered the business in late 2019 with hopes of using its popular marketplace site and massive data sets to profit from buying and selling homes in high volumes. What started off as a boon turned into a money pit. ""We determined that further scaling up Zillow Offers is too risky, too volatile to our earnings and operations, too low of a return on equity opportunity and too narrow in its ability to serve our customers,"" Barton said. ""Weve been unable to accurately forecast future home prices at different times in both directions by much more than we modeled as possible.""

Stock Price,https://qz.com/2017901/amc-issued-new-shares-but-that-hasnt-killed-its-stock-price/,AMC issued new shares but that hasn't killed its stock price.,"AMC Entertainment, the movie theater chain-turned-surging meme stock, has been cashing in on its unlikely rise. Since its stock started climbing at the end of January, the company has issued more than 100 million shares, unlike fellow internet darling GameStop, which has largely held off on selling new stock.Issuing new stock generally dilutes the value of a share, and is typically done when a company thinks its shares are overpriced. But so far, AMC’s stock price hasn’t really been hurt.In the last few weeks, AMC surpassed GameStop in market capitalization, the value of its outstanding shares, which shot up from around $5 billion at the start of April to a high of $34 billion last week. In that time, GameStop’s market cap also grew, but less exuberantly, from around $13 billion to peak at $19 billion in June.AMC issues more sharesAfter riding the internet hype train to a new high of $62.55 a share last week, AMC told regulators that it would sell an additional 11.6 million new shares, even as it warned traders not to buy its common stock “unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.” Although AMC stock had fallen to $47.91 by the end of the week, today it shot up by 14% to $55 per share, showing that at least for now, the sell-off hasn’t had a major impact. After all, AMC was trading for less than $2 per share in January.AMC also plans to ask shareholders to approve a change to its corporate charter that would allow it to issue another 25 million shares.GameStop’s strategySince GameStop became a headline-grabbing meme stock in early January, the company has only issued 3.5 million new shares of its stock, and it did so in April, once the stock appeared somewhat more stable.Kelly Shue, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management, said that in issuing a significant amount of additional shares, AMC is following a “more standard corporate finance strategy” than GameStop. “When the GameStop share price was very high and it was the main hot meme stock, I think most corporate finance professors would’ve said, ‘Oh GameStop should issue more shares.’ And they actually chose not to really do that much,” Shue said. “Whereas AMC is very much following the standard playbook.”For what it’s worth, GameStop’s stock has done just fine since its April issue, which raised $551 million. GameStop shares are up above $280 per share, still down from a January peak of $347 per share, but meteorically higher than the $4 per share at which it was trading last June.But neither of these stocks are at all predictable. Both companies are operating in a very volatile environment and their share prices are not necessarily tied to fundamentals. Whether or not those prices maintain their lofty levels, the movie theater chain will have capitalized on its moment in the sun."

Stock Price,https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/yahoo-verizon-public/523599/,Taking Stock of Yahoo in Its Final Days as a Public Company,"After 21 years on the open market, it’s likely that Yahoo will soon no longer be a publicly traded company. On Tuesday, Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s CEO, issued a statement marking Yahoo’s “final quarter as an independent company” that accompanied what is set to be its last public quarterly earnings report. The company’s revenue for the first quarter of 2017, at $834 million, was slightly better than analysts expected, which some have taken as an indication of the beleaguered company’s remaining potential.Last year, Yahoo announced that it would sell its core internet business—its search engine and websites—to Verizon, and that $4.5 billion deal will close in June. Verizon’s plan is to combine Yahoo with AOL and use the two struggling internet pioneers to strengthen Verizon’s push into mobile and video ad sales. The resulting company, which will be called Oath, will reportedly be run by Tim Armstrong, the current CEO of AOL. (Mayer will step down from Yahoo’s board of directors once the deal closes.)Yahoo’s core business has been struggling for years as it lost ground to competitors like Facebook and Google. As this happened, investors have been slowly writing off the company’s core business, and Yahoo’s corporate assets—stakes in Yahoo Japan and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba that are worth nearly $45 billion—became crucial to the company’s market value. Eventually, the market’s valuation of Yahoo became more about its assets than its internet operations. At one point, factoring out its lucrative Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes, markets actually considered the core business to be worth less than $0—a notion that many analysts found absurd. Still, Yahoo’s decision to sell off its original business to the highest bidder is a path struggling companies often take, as being acquired does bring some benefits. *In recent years, many public companies facing uncertainty—including Blackberry and Dell—have also been acquired, and there’s a chance that folding Yahoo’s core business into a different company could help it. That’s in part because turning around troubled companies can require dramatic, long-term change—something that’s a tough sell for public companies catering to shareholders’ short-term interests. There are drawbacks to being a private company—sometimes the new owners can be even more focused on short-term profits than the old ones—but there’s lately been a trend of public companies going private again. Yahoo’s core business will become part of Verizon, a publicly traded company, but it will only be a small part of Verizons $200 billion telecommunication business.Yahoo’s acquisition has not been without incident. The deal was renegotiated after Yahoo disclosed last December that more than a billion of its users’ accounts were compromised in 2013, the largest data breach in history. After conducting some studies that indicated its reputation wasn’t damaged beyond repair, Verizon decided to stick with the deal but lowered its original offer by $350 million. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s stakes in Yahoo Japan and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba are being spun off into a company called Altaba—an upgrade from “RemainCo,” a nickname that took off because the assets were so substantial."
Stock Price,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/22/peloton-stock-future/,"After stock price collapse, Peloton faces tough questions about post-pandemic future","Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareIt’s been a rough ride in recent years for Peloton. The at-home fitness company soared after going public at $29 a share in late 2019 — and then the pandemic hit. Sales of Peloton’s stationary bikes and treadmills increased 172 percent during the early lockdowns. Millions of fans paid to stream its classes. Its stock price topped $160.But Peloton has suffered a series of setbacks since then, including a nasty fight with safety regulators after a young boy was killed by one of its treadmills and doubts about whether Peloton — along with fellow pandemic darling, Netflix — can continue to grow as the pandemic fades.The company was pummeled Thursday when its financial results failed to impress analysts and the company said it is considering laying off workers and reshaping its production. Its stock price tumbled to about $24 — below where it began two years ago. It closed Friday at just above $27.AdvertisementNow Peloton and its chief executive John Foley face an uncertain future.The company needs to contend with growing competition from reopening gyms and from companies such as Apple expanding into fitness tech. And there are questions about how Peloton has dealt with its growing roster of problems.“They are starting to add up,” said Bernie McTernan, a senior analyst at Needham & Company. “I think something that people are wondering: Is this performance because of bad news or bad luck?”The fate of Peloton has attracted additional attention because of its cultural significance. The brand is a lightning rod for people who sneer at the luxury equipment — prices start at $1,495 — and lampoon its exercise classes.But Peloton also inspires a deep affinity, with a community of hundreds of Facebook groups and a popular Reddit forum. There’s a subgenre online of people describing how they were converted into Peloton fans.Still, Peloton took a huge hit Thursday — its stock price dropping 24 percent — after a CNBC report citing internal documents said that the company planned to temporarily halt production of its signature bikes and treadmills because of slowing demand.AdvertisementFoley slammed the report in a message posted on the firm’s website, calling it “incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton’s strategy.” But he also acknowledged that the company needed “to review our cost structure” and that layoffs were on the table as “options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”That same day, Peloton said its subscription revenue in the last three months of 2021 came in below its own expectations. It also reported a net loss of $372 million, compared with a loss of nearly $50 million at the same time last year.Peloton did not respond to a request for comment Friday.Peloton’s fortunes have been waning since the start of 2021 — compounded by a series of corporate missteps.In April, Peloton aggressively fought federal safety regulators over whether to recall its $4,300 Tread+ treadmill.AdvertisementThe Consumer Product Safety Commission wanted Peloton to pull the product off the market after a 6-year-old boy was sucked under the treadmill and killed. The agency soon learned the treadmill was connected to at least 39 incidents involving children, objects and one pet being trapped under the machine.The company shifted from attacking regulators to backing down once its resistance was publicized. It finally agreed to a recall.In December, Peloton got a public-relations black eye when the Mr. Big character died after riding a Peloton bike in a new episode of the Sex and the City series reboot. Peloton responded with an ad featuring the same character, alive and well, planning a Peloton ride. But that ad was pulled after the actor, Chris Noth, was accused of sexual assault.Despite Peloton’s stumbles, the collapse of its stock price is not a signal that the company itself is likely to disappear, according to analysts.AdvertisementWhile most analysts’ price targets for Peloton stock were slashed by half after the bad news Thursday, the expected prices were all still between $30 and $50.“This is still a valuable business,” McTernan said.He pointed to the 2. 7 million subscribers, many of them paying $13 a month to access the online classes.Peloton also reported Thursday a monthly churn rate among subscribers of less than 1 percent — a good sign for the company.Peloton’s subscription model is what makes the company different from other firms such as the fitness watch maker Fitbit and the camera maker GoPro, which never recovered after initially high-flying debuts, McTernan said.Peloton’s problem is that it needs to change.“It’s seemingly not in the hyper-growth game,” he said, “then profitability is more important.”GiftOutline Gift Article"

Since March 1, GameStops stock has yo-yoed between $78 and $189. On Tuesday, shares dropped 5.1%, resulting in the New York Stock Exchange halting trading of the stock briefly.These developments have many people wondering why GameStops stock continues to perform beyond expectations.The origin storyEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty ImagesGameStop is a brick-and-mortar retail shop founded in 1984 where customers buy, sell and trade video games and other gaming accessories.""GameStop as a business, if we separate it from the stock itself, was a dying business in a sense,"" Mullally told NPR.Hedge funds thought the same way in 2021.""About a year ago, they saw the price of the stock at around $20 was overvalued,"" and started shorting the stock, Mullally said.Shorting means investors are betting against the company and will profit if the value of the asset falls.Last year, amateur day traders banded together to push the video game retailers stock price higher. The traders, organized largely through internet communities on Reddit, sought to fuel a short squeeze on the video game retailer and trigger major losses for hedge funds.Melvin Capital and Citron were two of the funds caught in the squeeze, forcing them to buy more GameStop stock to cover their losses, which ended up driving the stock price even higher.Jaime Rogozinski, the founder of WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, told All Things Considered last year that, ""its the democratization of financial markets"" that is ""giving a voice to the people that didnt previously have one.""Mullally didnt expect the fanfare over GameStop to last nearly as long as it has.""My prediction was that this couldnt persist because eventually people were going to lose money. Eventually this would have to end,"" Mullally said. ""So far I have been proven wrong.""Thats largely due to the support of online communities.""Anytime this dips under $100, people come back in and prop it up,"" he added.Whats going on now and why?Part of this bump in price is likely thanks to GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen purchasing shares in the company, said Christopher Kardatzke, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Quiver Quantitative Inc., an alternative data company for retail investors.Last week, Cohen purchased 100,000 shares of the video game retailer — bringing his ownership to 11.9%, CNBC reported. He purchased these shares through his investment company, RC VenturesA move like this ""is seen as an indicator of the insider sentiment of their own company. Its a valuable metric,"" Kardatzke told NPR. ""This likely caused more people to have more confidence in investing in GameStop.""Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesTraders closely monitoring GameStop have no doubt witnessed the volatility of the stock itself, he said.""When you see price movement in a stock like GameStop it generates a lot of discussion and gets a lot of people interested in what its going to do next,"" Kardatzke said.Mullally noted that it likely all comes down to supply and demand.The more interest GameStop stock generates, the more demand some traders seem to have for it, he said.Mullally admits he remains baffled by the interest in a stock that he views as not especially valuable.""GameStop as a company is not doing anything productive,"" he said. ""But its like people buying pet rocks or Beanie Babies. Those things are fundamentally worthless. Its strange and I dont understand it. But there are a lot of strange things that people buy and I dont understand."""

The companys operating expenses are increasing faster than its sales. Amazon invested heavily to staff up its warehouses and combat supply chain challenges, and it now faces rising inflation, as well as increasing transportation and labor costs.Amazon said Thursday it projects revenue between $116 billion to $121 billion in the second quarter, trailing the $125.5 billion average analyst estimate, according to Refinitiv.Shares of Amazon closed down 14% on Friday after the company gave revenue outlook for the current quarter that fell short of Wall Streets estimates. Its Amazons worst day since July 2006.The second-quarter forecast suggests revenue growth could dip to a range of 3% to 7% from a year earlier, representing a further slowdown from the first quarter, when revenue at Amazon increased 7%.Amazon also lost about $3.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $8.1 billion a year ago. The companys investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian weighed on its profits.""While sales were short of expectations by a mere $6 million, the bigger headline was the companys first quarterly loss since 2015, at a loss per share of $7.56, or nearly $16.00 shy of the Streets earnings per share expectations,"" said William Blair analysts, who have an outperform rating on Amazon shares, in a note to clients on Thursday. ""Under the hood, the company reported an $8 billion pretax loss related to its investment in Rivian Automotive. Recall the company reported a $12 billion benefit in the prior quarter related to the investment. We estimate the companys earnings per share excluding the investment-related loss would be roughly $3.40, still 60% below consensus as the company continues to face headwinds related to shipping, labor, excess capacity, and tough prior-year comparisons.""Analysts like Truist Securities Youssef Squali remain bullish that Amazons outlook will improve in the second half of the year.

The stock is down 55% year-to-date, and its decline accelerated in recent weeks. This comes as the company has worked to expand its sales footprint into Europe and to increase its production capacity.But Nio has had four consecutive months of decreasing vehicle deliveries, due in part to the supply chain issues that have been affecting most automotive companies globally. Most recently, however, a new operational challenge has been added to its list of them.Nio is getting hit hard again Monday as U.S.-listed Chinese companies are looking more at risk of being delisted. In December 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) became law, allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist foreign companies that fail to meet U.S. accounting and audit standards for three straight years.Last week, five Chinese companies were specifically named as being in danger of meeting that criterion, meaning they could be delisted in 2024 if they fail to comply. Neither Nio nor any other EV maker was on that list. But that hasnt stopped investors from selling shares based on the perceived risk. Nio also completed a successful listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last week. Investors may believe that move was in preparation for a potential delisting of its American depositary shares.The geopolitical climate isnt helping with investor confidence either. There are added uncertainties regarding the prices and availability of many commodities as Russias invasion of Ukraine continues. Investors may also be weighing how Europe, the U.S., and others will view Chinas position during and after that conflict.Investors need to balance short-term news and uncertainties with long-term plans and potential. There are always risks when investing in equities. While what appears to be panic selling may provide an opportunity for investors to buy Nio shares at lower valuations, they should also be sure to weigh the potential risk of delisting. That means allocating funds for any position appropriately, knowing the investment could be lost in a worst-case scenario."

[+] House on April 04, 2019. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty ImagesDonald Trump often measures his performance in the White House by how the stock market performs. Unfortunately, by that measure, his trade war with China has failed. New research by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University found U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in the price of their stocks due to increased U.S. tariffs against imports from China.On March 1, 2018, Donald Trump moved forward with his first significant step in a trade war with China by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, which included tariffs on Chinese imports. In July 2018, the Trump administration imposed 25% duties on imports from China, followed by 25% tariffs on more products from China in August 2018, and a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of goods from China in September 2018. In 2019, more tariffs followed. The tariffs had an impact on U.S. company stock values because, it turns out, tariff increases are a form of industrial policy that lose money for U.S. companies and investors.“We find that U.S. and Chinese tariff announcements lowered U.S. aggregate equity prices in our sample of close to 3,000 listed firms by 6.0 percentage points: a $1.7 trillion reduction in market value for our sample of listed firms,” according to new research by Mary Amiti, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Sang Hoon Kong and David Weinstein, both economists at Columbia University. The study noted that 3.4 percentage points of the 6.0 percent decline in equity prices “can be attributed to the common effects” [effects that matter in general to companies] and “2.6 percentage points can be attributed to the differentially poor performance of firms importing from, exporting to, or selling in China.”To conduct the research, the economists identified 11 “candidate” events: “U.S. tariff events, Chinese retaliation events, and other trade war related events that do not involve U.S. or Chinese tariffs. Our first event is the March 1, 2018 announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs (which also targeted China). We classify this event along with the March 22, 2018 event, the September 17, 2018 announcement of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, and the May 10, 2019 announcement of the increase in tariffs of those imports from 10 to 25 percent as ‘U.S. tariff’ events.”The research found U.S. tariff announcements caused most of the reduction in U.S. market values. Announcements by China of retaliatory measures had “small effects.” One reason for this may be that the U.S. tariff announcement was the surprise event, not the retaliation. Moreover, fewer U.S. exports go to China than Chinese imports come into the United States, which means retaliatory tariffs have less of an economic impact. And, finally, the researchers note, “Chinese retaliation may have been priced into the reactions to U.S. tariff announcements.”Tariff increases affect U.S. consumers, companies and shareholders. A September 2019 National Foundation for American Policy analysis concluded, “By our calculation, from 2017 through the end of 2018, the Trump tariffs cost the average U.S. household $374. In 2019, the cost per household increased to $461 annually,” if the tariffs remained in place through the end of the year.Less examined has been the trade war’s impact on U.S. investors, including members of the public who own stocks directly or through mutual funds and retirement accounts. “Our study finds that the U.S.-China trade war depressed stock prices, which implies negative impacts on firms and their shareholders,” economics professor David Weinstein told me. “Shareholders lost money, and the lower returns to capital causes firms to invest less.”The study likely underestimates the negative impact of tariffs. The economists measured the effect on companies publicly traded on the stock market. “This means that the national impact might be more negative if unlisted firms, e.g., farmers, were also adversely affected on average or less negative if the tariffs caused new entry into protected sectors like steel and aluminum.”The study did not look at foreign multinational companies, which invest in the U.S. economy and employ many U.S. workers. Another issue: “We can only estimate the impact of the unanticipated component of the announcements. This means that to the extent that markets anticipated the trade war, we are likely to have underestimated the effects.” The study also did not address trade disruptions outside of tariffs.What should we learn from the research about the impact of the trade war with China? “An important lesson for policymakers is that the trade war had a much broader and larger impact than what one might surmise based on the relatively small share of firms importing or exporting to China,” said Weinstein. “Since much of the escalation of the trade war occurred in 2019, a substantial portion of the estimated negative impact on investment growth rates is going to be felt this year.”There is a reason the stock market generally has declined when Donald Trump raised tariffs on U.S. consumers and companies that purchase goods from China – tariffs are bad for business. Tariffs harm investors, including Americans who own stocks or invest money in mutual funds. When politicians claim to be “tough” on trade with China, it turns out the people most likely to be harmed are Americans."

The company’s stock, DE, even made the news surrounding the divorce of Bill and Melinda Gates.Cascade Investment, the investment company established by Bill Gates, transferred approximately 2.25 million shares to Melinda Gates, totaling around $851 million in worth, last May. The transfer caught attention since it comprised a large chunk of the $3 billion or so that Melinda Gates is believed to have received to date.Here’s a look at Deere as it reports its first-quarter 2022 earnings to give you the information you need to know before investing in the company.A Stable Foundation in PlaceIn the commercial farming sector, Deere benefits from the longtime strength of its brand, as well as a current wave of reorders that were anticipated but, until recently, weren’t guaranteed.Despite raising prices to offset increasing shipping and supply-chain costs, Deere appears to be experiencing strong demand for agriculture equipment, thanks in part to high grain prices and government support for farmers, Reuters reported.Building WealthA Company Investing In ItselfDeere is gaining attention for multiple pivots forward — decisions that could expand the company’s consumer base and increase prices and margins. Many industry analysts like Deere’s commitment to modernizing agriculture — and the company has been working on several developments.Smart Farming SolutionsDeere & Co. has been investing in smart farming solutions, such as technology that offers farmers real-time data points to use to make decisions about when to prepare soil, plant and nurture seeds and harvest plants. Deere also purchased Harvest Profit, a software with a focus on farm profitability.Drought Management TechnologyThe company has invested in precision agriculture — giving farmers the ability to manage drought risk using information from satellites. This not only helps protect farms against potential losses, but also carries the possibility of using drought-prone crops of land, such as grasslands and pasture.Using these more precarious types of land for farming with the help of satellite guidance could increase yields, profits and equipment needs. That’s potentially good news for Deere and its investors.Self-Driving TractorsIn 2004, Deere & Co. entered into a partnership with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory with the goal of improving its self-driving tractors. Deere used NASA’s technology to advance the self-guidance ability of its tractors, but it continued to work on its own technology.Building WealthAlthough it now relies on its own system, Deere placed a strategic bet by partnering with NASA until it could reach full proficiency with self-driving tractors on its own. According to its earnings presentation for the first quarter of 2022, Deere plans to deliver a fully autonomous battery-powered agricultural tractor by 2026.New Deal With UnionsAs GOBankingRates reported last month, 10,000 Deere employees — members of the United Auto Workers Union — went on strike in October “for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules.” The union approved a six-year contract on Nov. 17, ending the strike.New Lines of RevenueAs Deere adds smart farming technology to its equipment and overall product mix, both sales and profit margins are on the rise. Software sales are becoming a regular component of equipment sales and could become a stand-alone order.An Expanding Customer BaseDeere’s opportunity in international markets is perhaps stronger than at any point in its history. As U.S. farms test the ways in which predictive technology can reduce farm labor and minimize losses, agricultural professionals from all over the world are likely to seek the same opportunity.Deere’s Earnings ResultsDeere & Co. stock has a one-year high of $400.34 and a one-year low of $320.50.CEO John C. May said in a statement accompanying the earnings release that “Deere’s performance in the first quarter was impressive given production issues surrounding the delayed ratification of our UAW contract in late November as well as persistent challenges posed by the supply chain and pandemic.” May acknowledged that these factors resulted in higher costs last quarter. Despite those challenges, Deere beat analysts’ estimates for Q1 2022, prompting the company to increase its annual profit forecast, Reuters reported.Here are some key metrics from the earnings report:Net sales and revenues: $9.57 billion, a 5% increase from the same quarter of 2021$9.57 billion, a 5% increase from the same quarter of 2021 Net income: $903 million, down 26% from the same quarter of 2021$903 million, down 26% from the same quarter of 2021 Earnings per share: $2.92, down from $3.87 for the first quarter of 2021In its revised guidance for 2022, Deere said it anticipates net income in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.1 billion, a slight upgrade based on the company’s prediction that demand for farm and construction equipment will continue to benefit from strong economic fundamentals.Is Deere Stock a Buy, Sell or Hold?The consensus among 22 analysts polled by Yahoo Finance is that Deere & Co. stock is a buy. The analysts’ average price target is $415.57, upgraded from $398.32 last quarter.Investors Should Be Ready for Uncertainty as the Pandemic Winds DownAlthough multiple factors will influence Deere’s performance in 2022, the company did enjoy the pandemic-era benefit of increased interest in compact equipment as Americans made landscaping more of a priority during lockdown.Despite first-quarter earnings delivering more than expected, shares dropped because EPS failed to meet 2021 figures — despite the stock price having reached an all-time high just a week before the earnings were released, Entrepreneur reported. It’s unrealistic to expect pandemic-spurred growth to continue in the transition to a post-pandemic economy, especially if farm profits decline, as predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and reported by Reuters, but it could take some time before sentiment catches up with the company’s strong fundamentals.Good To Know At one point during the coronavirus pandemic, Deere stock had fallen more than 40%. However, the company’s solid quarter-to-quarter performance, paired with anticipation around President Biden’s infrastructure plan, which he signed into law in November 2021, appear to have offered Deere some shelter.The company appears positioned for growth due to the infiltration of technology into its product lines and the likely appeal of technology to farmers in other parts of the world. However, investors will need to watch and see if Deere’s growth tactics are enough in the short term to meet those trajectories head-on at this moment.Deere isn’t likely to go anywhere. The question is simply this: How soon can it get to where it’s going, and how much of the market’s confidence can it keep in the meantime?Daria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.Data is accurate as of Feb. 21, 2022, and subject to change.Share this article:"

The company issued a press release on Friday noting that it had received word from the NYSE that its share price was “not in compliance” with the exchange’s requirement that Class A Common Stock for a listed company be at least $1.00 over the course of a consecutive 30-day trading period.Bird’s share price has followed a fairly consistent downward trajectory since its debut via a SPAC merger last November. The closing price has remained below $1 per share since around mid-May, just after when it reported its first fiscal quarterly earnings for 2022. Those results saw revenue, gross margins and ride profit drop quarter over quarter — those ride profits grew considerably year over year.The non-compliance note from NYSE doesn’t mean immediate delisting — it’s a preliminary step that gives Bird six months to get back in compliance, which means holding an average share price of at least $1 across a span of 30 consecutive trading days and also having a share value above $1 on the final trading day of that same month. To get above water, Bird says in its release that it will be considering a number of options, including a reverse stock split (pending shareholder approval).Bird’s share price closed at $0.5558 on the trading day."

The pharmaceuticals division generated more than 55% of total sales and grew nearly 7% on a strict, as-reported basis. That helped offset overall weakness from a strong U.S. dollar. Notably, the companys one-shot Covid vaccine brought in nearly double what analysts projected.But sales from the companys consumer health and medtech divisions each fell roughly 1%.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson continues to highlight its cancer treatments. The company recently said more than three-quarters of patients with an aggressive form of multiple myeloma responded to a combination approach in Phase 1 testing. Further, three years of treatment with Imbruvica led to ""deep and durable"" responses in leukemia patients.Shares are now well below a double-bottom base, according to MarketSmith.com. In midday trading on July 19 — following the earnings report — JNJ stock fell about 6% below its buy point. Savvy investors are encouraged to sell shares when they fall 7%-8% below their entry.J&J is working to separate its consumer health division and has entered into a series of settlements for its part in the opioid crisis.The Dow Jones stalwart now expects $93.3 billion to $94.3 billion in full-year sales.So, all things considered, is JNJ stock now a sell?JNJ Stock: Earnings, Sales BeatDuring the second quarter, Johnson & Johnson earned $2.59 per share on $24.02 billion in sales. Both metrics beat analysts forecasts, but grew minimally. Earnings rose 4% while sales climbed 3%.J&J reported strong growth from psoriasis treatment Stelara and cancer drug Darzalex, up a respective 14% and 39% vs. the year-earlier period. Prostate cancer treatment Erleada and schizophrenia medicine Invega are also gaining share.But medtech and consumer health sales fell. Advanced surgery sales were light, analysts said.But medical device sales were a bright spot. Orthopedic, surgical and vision sales all climbed higher.In the current quarter, JNJ stock analysts forecast adjusted earnings of $2.63 per share on $23.92 billion in sales. Earnings would inch up 3 cents vs. the same quarter last year. Sales would rise about 2.5%.JNJ stock didnt meet the bar for CAN SLIM investors in the second quarter, and isnt expected to do so in the third. Investors are encouraged to seek stocks with recent earnings and sales growth of 20%-25%.Expectations For 2022During its second-quarter report, Johnson & Johnson trimmed its full-year outlook for 2022. The firm expects adjusted earnings of $10.05 a share on sales of $93.8 billion. Thats based on the midpoint of its outlook.For the year, JNJ stock analysts were looking for adjusted profit of $10.19 per share on $96.05 billion in sales. Both measures would climb less than 10% year over year.Last year, Johnson & Johnson brought in $93.78 billion in sales, popping nearly 14%. The company also reported adjusted profit of $9.80 per share, surging 22%.Johnson & Johnson Technical AnalysisJohnson & Johnson stock is now about 6% below its entry out of a double-bottom base.Shares of J&J have an Investors Business Daily Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99. The CR scores a stocks key growth metrics against all other stocks regardless of industry group.

The RS Rating measures a stocks 12-month performance on a 1-99 scale against all other stocks. Most big winners have an RS Rating of 80 or higher before they break out on major price runs. This puts J&J shares among leading stocks.Legal Settlements AboundJohnson & Johnson is now emerging from under a cloud of litigation.Earlier this year, the company agreed to pay $5 billion to settle claims it contributed to the opioid crisis in the U.S. Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) will pay $21 billion.Further, Johnson & Johnson added another $99 million settlement in West Virginia in April.J&J also recently spun out its talcum powder business following claims its compound led people to develop cancer. Then, the new company immediately filed for bankruptcy. Before that, J&J pulled its baby powder brand from shelves in the U.S. and Canada.In other news, the company is separating its consumer health division into a new company. This will allow J&J to focus on high-growth products, including its drugs and medical devices. In 2021, those units generated more than $79 billion in sales.JNJ Stock News: New Cancer DataRecently, Johnson & Johnson said it added a new drug, dubbed teclistamab, to its approved medicine Darzalex Faspro in patients with aggressive multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. At a median follow-up of 8.6 months, 76.5% of patients who could be evaluated had responded to the treatment.The company also said three years of treatment with its approved drug, Imbruvica, resulted in ""deep and durable"" responses for patients with lymphocytic leukemia. Imbruvica helped lengthen the amount of time before patients cancer worsened and improved overall survival.But initial results from a midstage study of its drug, Balversa, in patients with solid tumors were mixed. J&J tested the treatment in patients with a specific genetic mutation behind their cancer, regardless of cancer type or location. Overall, 29.2% of patients responded, meaning their tumors shrank. But 72.5% of patients were deemed to have their cancer under control.Is JNJ Stock A Sell?Johnson & Johnson stock wasnt a buy on July 19. By at least one measure, it could be a sell. Shares have yet to fall 7%-8% below their previous entry, but have toppled below their 50-day moving average. The latter is a particularly bearish sign. Institutional investors are now using this line as a sell level.The companys fundamentals are improving, and litigation risk is starting to lessen.Still, JNJ stock analysts dont expect sales growth to meet CAN SLIM marks in the third quarter. But big players like Johnson & Johnson can still rise without adding massive gains.To find the best stocks to buy and watch, keep tabs on IBD Stock Lists.

Stock Price,https://www.investors.com/news/technology/jnj-stock-buy-now/,GameStop's Stock Price In The Lead Up To Its Stock Split,"It has been a volatile four months for GameStop’s (NYSE: GME) stock since the company announced its planned stock split on March 31. The stock split is to take place at the close of Thursday July 21.Four-for-one splitOn March 31, GameStop disclosed plans to carry out a stock split by boosting its share count to 1 billion from 300 million. A stock split does not necessarily increase a company’s market capitalization, but it makes a stock more attractive and more affordable for small investors. At the time of the announcement, GameStop said the move would “provide flexibility for future corporate needs.” The plan secured board approval on July 6 and on Monday, July 18, shareholders will receive three additional shares for each of their class A share, which will be distributed after the close of trading on July 21.Stock price since split announcementIn the four months since the announcement of the split, GameStop’s stock has fallen to as low as $77.77 on May 12, and to as high as $153.00. On Friday, the company closed 4% higher on the New York Stock Exchange, and 3.5% higher on the following Monday at $146.64, an almost three-month high. Based on its closing price on Monday, the split would mean that GameStop’s share price would only cost around $36.GME 1D, with Pivot pointsStock split maniaGameStop’s move follows that of tech heavyweights like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which enacted stock splits in 2020 and new stock splits by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) this year. The need for Alphabet and Amazon stock splits were as expected as their share prices have hovered around $3,000 in recent months. But for GameStop, some financial watchers have questioned the company’s intent to do a split as its financials are failing to keep up with its stock price. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, GameStop incurred a net loss of $381 million, up 77% from its $215 million loss in 2020. That is despite revenue climbing to $6.01 billion from $5.09 billion. There have also been concerns that GameStop may be going out of business as the company had announced store closures and booked millions of dollars in debt. In its most recent earnings report, however, the company’s first-quarter revenue beat market estimates, which some have attributed to its shift towards a more online-focused model. The company had earlier disclosed plans to foray into non-fungible tokens or NFTs by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. The plan has raised some eyebrows from market watchers including Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who described the move as “nonsense,” saying it will ""have no NFTs for sale and no customers, and wallets they are providing will be empty."""
Stock Price,https://www.barrons.com/articles/rivian-stock-price-target-cut-51646139153,Op-ed: The housing shortage will actually benefit homebuilder stocks. Here are some companies to watch,"Ariel Skelley | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe double whammy of a declining stock market and rising interest rates has been pummeling homebuilder stocks this year, resulting in rock-bottom valuations. Those valuations make housing stocks look like the worst home in a bad neighborhood. But in reality, the industry is the cheapest house in an undervalued neighborhood. In early April, the average forward price/earnings ratio of homebuilder stock prices to projected 2022 earnings was only four times earnings, the lowest of any industry in the entire U.S. stock market. This ratio dipped to 3.5 in mid-May, when the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) was down about 30% year-to-date. Shares of some large builders, like industry leader D.H. Horton, have fallen by nearly 40% this year. This decline has been triggered, in part, by investors assumption that rising mortgage interest rates will hollow out the market by discouraging buyers. Never mind that bidding wars in some brisk local markets are producing sale prices higher than lender appraisals, forcing buyers to come up with additional cash at closing.This market heat hasnt stopped investors from dumping shares out of fear that rising rates will soon tamp down demand. As a result, many of these stocks have gone from being a bit overpriced to substantially underpriced in just a few months. Yet rumors of the industrys impending weakness have been greatly exaggerated. The battered condition of these stocks is actually an opportunity — reflected by elevated price targets from analysts — because data indicates that a chronic housing shortage will continue to fuel high demand, despite higher rates. Though mortgage rates are expected to keep rising, theyre still quite low and will likely remain that way for at least the next year or two. In the past several months, typical rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have shot up to about 5% from around 3%. Yet historically, this is by no means high. Since 2011, rates had rarely dipped below 5%, and many buyers shopping for their second or third homes can remember paying 8% to 9% in 2000 or 10% to 11% a decade earlier.Faced with the alternative of soaring apartment rents — as of April, up an average of more than 25% year over year and expected to continue rising with high inflation — many buyers will undoubtedly still see owning as the best financial option. Many of those with already-challenged budgets will just buy less expensive homes, so higher rates may suppress demand largely at the lower end. Priced-out low-end buyers may be forced to rent, benefitting builders of multi-family housing. The current dearth of available homes is likely to continue for as much as a decade. Statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and Credit Suisse show the depth of this shortage with these readings of key market gauges: Historically, the nation has had a running supply of about 1.5 million homes available for purchase. The current inventory of single- and multi-family available homes — about 700,000 — is the lowest in more than 40 years.Though homes are now being constructed at a blistering pace, the nation hasnt been building anywhere near enough for the last 17 years. Since home construction peaked in 2005 with more than 2 million housing starts, there has been an average of 500,000 fewer starts per year, resulting in a deficit of about 3 million homes. This shortage has been easing a bit lately, but it could easily take another decade for supply to equal demand.Excess building prior to the Great Recession resulted in an oversupply of nearly 2 million homes, but this supply was exhausted by 2014. Subsequent underbuilding caused supply to plummet over the next several years, resulting in a deficit of 3 million homes by 2020. Even with building now increasing apace, the long period of underbuilding will sustain the supply deficit for years to come.Exacerbating the shortage has been the age of American housing stock. As of 2019, the median age of a home in this country was 41 years. Now its 44 — the oldest on record. In evaluating investment opportunities, investors probably should consider smaller-cap companies, though some of the larger names are poised for good returns over the next year or two. Suppliers also stand to benefit from long-term demand."
