"The closing price has remained below $1 per share since around mid-May, just after when it reported its first fiscal quarterly earnings for 2022.",1
"The non-compliance note from NYSE doesn’t mean immediate delisting — it’s a preliminary step that gives Bird six months to get back in compliance, which means holding an average share price of at least $1 across a span of 30 consecutive trading days and also having a share value above $1 on the final trading day of that same month.",1
"To get above water, Bird says in its release that it will be considering a number of options, including a reverse stock split (pending shareholder approval).",1
