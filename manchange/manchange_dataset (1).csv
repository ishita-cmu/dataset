The announced changes come days after reports circulated that Peloton could soon be a takeover target.,1
"But news of a management shakeup and strategic overhaul make this path seem much less likely, at least in the near term.",1
"The connected fitness company announced Tuesday that Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, will become CEO and president and join Peloton's board.",1
"McCarthy, 68, currently serves on the board of delivery start-up Instacart.",1
"Founder John Foley will step down from the CEO post, and become executive chairman of the board.",1
"""Since founding Peloton a decade ago, we've grown this brand to engage and motivate a loyal community of more than 6.6 million members,"" said Foley, in a press release announcing the leadership changes.",1
"""I'm incredibly proud to have worked with such talented teammates over the years who have helped me build Peloton into what it is today, and I'm confident that Barry is the right leader to take the company into its next phase of growth.""",1
Foley pointed to McCarthy's previous experience managing subscription business models and digital streaming companies.,1
"In January, Peloton reported preliminary quarterly revenue and subscriber figures, but Tuesday's announcement also included a lower forecast for the year.",1
"Peloton now anticipates fiscal 2022 revenue within a range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, down from prior expectations of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion.",1
"Previously, it projected it would have 3.35 million to 3.45 million.",1
These are people who own one of Peloton's products and also pay a monthly fee to access its on-demand content.,0
Peloton said it expects to slash roughly $800 million in annual costs and reduce capital expenditures by roughly $150 million this year.,1
"It plans to wind down the development of its Peloton Output Park, the $400 million factory that it was building in Ohio.",1
It said it will reduce its delivery teams and the amount of warehouse space it owns and operates.,1
"""The decisions we have made will make us a leaner and more nimble organization that is better able to execute against our sizable growth opportunity,"" said Foley, in a separate letter to shareholders.",1
"Peloton is expecting to cut 2,800 jobs, or about 20% of its corporate positions.",1
The cuts won't affect its instructor roster or content.,1
"But Foley did announce that his wife, Jill Foley, is leaving her role as vice president of Peloton's apparel business.",1
"Peloton employed 6,743 people in the United States as of June 30, more than double the roughly 3,281 employees it counted a year earlier, according to annual filings.",1
But the company miscalculated how sustainable this trend would be.,1
"Roughly a week ago, activist Blackwells Capital — which has a less than 5% stake in the company — sent a letter to Peloton's board urging Foley to quit his role as CEO, and asking the company to consider selling itself.",1
Reports have since circulated that potential suitors could include Amazon or Nike.,1
"However, Foley along with other Peloton insiders had a combined voting control of roughly 80% as of Sept. 30, which would make it practically impossible for any deal to go through without their approval.",1
"""Peloton CEO John Foley naming himself Executive Chairman and hiring a new CFO does not address any of Peloton investors' concerns,"" Aintabi said in a statement.",1
"""Mr. Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or Executive Chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done today.""",1
"Foley, 51, founded Peloton in 2012.",1
He previously served as the president at Barnes & Noble.,1
"Foley also brought on his wife, Jill, to lead up Peloton's apparel business — a decision Blackwells has also criticized.",1
"As part of the management changes, William Lynch, Peloton's president, will step down from his executive role but remain a director.",1
"Lynch, a former Barnes & Noble CEO, was brought on by Foley in 2017 to help drive growth.",1
"PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rent-A-Center, Inc. (NASDAQ/NGS:RCII), a leading provider of technology driven and flexible leasing solutions for consumers, today announced that as of March 28, 2022 Aaron Allred has assumed the role of Executive Vice President, Acima.",1
"Moving forward Mr. Allred will oversee all aspects of the Acima business and report to Mitch Fadel, Chief Executive Officer of Rent-A-Center, Inc. Jason Hogg, former Executive Vice President, Acima, has departed the Company.",1
Adjusted EBITDA figures now exclude stock based compensation.,1
"(3) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of incremental depreciation and amortization related to the estimated fair value of acquired Acima assets, stock compensation expense associated with the Acima acquisition equity consideration subject to vesting conditions, and one-time transaction and integration costs related to the Acima acquisition.",0
"“Special items” refers to certain gains and charges we view as extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring in nature and which we believe do not reflect our core business activities.",0
"That's the day former Disney CEO Bob Iger's relationship with his handpicked successor, current Disney CEO Bob Chapek, began to fall apart.",1
"Iger had stunned the world in February of that year by resigning as Disney's chief executive, effective immediately.",1
"He elevated Chapek, whom Iger and the board had long seen internally as the front-runner for the position given his operational experience and decades at the company.",1
"Iger would stick around as executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors"" to help with the transition.",1
The timing of a CEO change at arguably the world's most famous entertainment company couldn't have been worse.,1
"Just weeks after Iger stepped down, Disney began closing its theme parks around the world during the initial stages of the Covid-19 quarantine.",1
Iger and Chapek seemed to be ready for the pandemic challenge together.,1
"""I can't think of a better person to succeed me in this role,"" Iger said March 11, 2020, during the company's annual shareholder meeting, a day before the company announced it would begin closing its parks.",1
Chapek returned the optimism.,1
"A Mouse House divided The pressure is on Disney CEO Bob Chapek, whose contract is up early next year.",1
Some key takeaways: Chapek and CEO Bob Iger's relationship soured after Iger gave comments to The New York Times about wanting to help Chapek run the company during the pandemic.,1
"Several employees have called Iger to express their dissatisfaction with Chapek over his response to Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.",1
"Chapek centralized budget power under his right-hand man, Kareem Daniel, a move that irritated several Disney veterans – as well as Iger.",1
"Like Iger, Chapek and Daniel want to speed up the pace of Disney's digital transformation.",1
"""I've watched Bob [Iger] lead this company to amazing new heights, and I've learned an enormous amount from that experience,"" Chapek said.",1
"One month after those comments, with everyone stuck at home, then-New York Times media columnist Ben Smith published a story after reaching Iger by email.",1
He reported Iger wasn't going to turn Chapek to the wolves as a brand-new CEO while the world was falling apart.,1
Iger told Smith he would stick around to help run the company.,1
"""A crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it, particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!""",1
"Chapek was furious when he saw the story, according to three people familiar with the matter.",1
Iger had postponed his retirement as CEO three times already.,1
"Chapek was already reporting to Iger, the board's chairman, anyway.",1
"Three days after Smith's story was published, Disney accelerated its timeline and named Chapek to its board.",1
"Bob Iger poses with Mickey Mouse attends Mickey's 90th Spectacular at The Shrine Auditorium on October 6, 2018 in Los Angeles.",1
"Since that incident, Iger and Chapek haven't been able to mend their relationship, according to about a dozen people familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC for this story.",1
"In the months that followed, Chapek began making key decisions about Disney's future — including a dramatic reorganization of the company and outing actress Scarlett Johansson's salary following a dispute over her Marvel movie ""Black Widow"" — without Iger's input.",1
"Internal messages about business strategy from both men would sometimes conflict, as it became clear the executives weren't speaking with one voice, several people noted.",1
"While much of the public narrative has centered around Iger's ""long goodbye"" — he departed as chairman in January — Chapek, 61, has actually been firmly in control of Disney for more than 18 months.",1
Normal times would have allowed Iger and Chapek to work more closely.,1
"Instead, the two executives barely spoke to each other.",1
"Chapek has a small circle of close confidants with whom he makes major decisions — longtime right-hand man Kareem Daniel, chief of staff Arthur Bochner, and, to some degree, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy, whom Iger promoted to the role in 2015, according to people familiar with the matter.",1
Iger hasn't been part of that circle.,1
"Late last year, just weeks before his departure as executive chairman, Iger threw himself a going-away party, inviting more than 50 people at his house in Brentwood, a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood.",1
"Chapek attended, but there was little interaction between the two men, according to people who attended the party.",1
"Guests — including veteran Disney executives and on-camera talent, such as broadcasters Robin Roberts, David Muir and Al Michaels — sat at two long tables at Iger's house.",1
Iger and Chapek sat at opposite tables.,1
"Chapek sat near several of his direct reports, including Daniel.",1
Iger sat next to film director and mogul Steven Spielberg.,1
"While Iger spent about 10 minutes publicly praising former colleagues, he barely mentioned Chapek, said the people.",1
Both Iger and Chapek declined to comment on their relationship with each other.,1
He also hasn't been able to benefit from the myriad relationships Iger developed from decades at Disney.,1
"Anyone succeeding Iger, who had been Disney's CEO since 2005, was going to have a difficult time filling his shoes.",1
"Iger, 71, has even flirted with running for president of the United States.",1
"Chapek, meanwhile, has a harder exterior and at times, according to colleagues, struggles with emotional intelligence — which happens to be Iger's strength.",1
"Bob Chapek, left, and Bob Iger.",1
This was Disney's second major reorganization in less than three years.,1
"The key part of the announcement was the following: ""The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content —both distribution and ad sales — and will oversee operations of the Company's streaming services.",1
"It will also have sole P&L accountability for Disney's media and entertainment businesses.""",1
Those two sentences upended how Disney has done business for decades.,1
"The change gave Daniel, the leader of the new Media and Entertainment Distribution group, called DMED internally, one of the most important jobs in the history of media.",1
"The decision was instantly polarizing, leading to a burst of internal frustration among some veteran Disney employees who no longer controlled the budgets of their divisions, according to people familiar with the matter.",1
Chapek wants to streamline Disney so content decisions across distribution platforms can be made in synchrony.,1
"Instead of division heads running their own fiefdoms, Chapek and Daniel can steer Disney by controlling the budgets of each group and deciding where content ends up — streaming or cable or broadcast or movie theaters.",1
"Executives can then focus on making content, or selling ads, or building streaming technology, with direction from Chapek and Daniel.",1
"Historically, the heads of Disney TV or ESPN or Hulu or film would run their entire businesses.",1
"Conceptually, Chapek's idea actually isn't all that different from what Iger had begun to put in place with the organization of Disney+.",1
"In early 2018, Iger met with Robert Kyncl, chief business officer at Google's YouTube, according to people familiar with the meeting.",1
"Before Google, Kyncl had worked for seven years at Netflix, overseeing content partnerships.",1
Google separated its content and distribution divisions.,1
"The same roles didn't live within smaller groups, the way Disney had been structured for years.",1
Kyncl declined to comment to CNBC about the meeting.,1
"If Disney wanted investors to see its burgeoning streaming service as the growth engine in a digital-first world, Iger realized he needed to centralize power around Disney+.",1
"According to two people familiar with the meeting, Iger urgently asked then-Disney head of strategy Kevin Mayer to return from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas so Iger could show him a new organizational structure, which he drew on a whiteboard in front of Mayer.",1
"Mayer would become the head of Disney's new direct-to-consumer unit, in charge of the company's streaming platforms: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.",1
Disney officially reorganized in March 2018.,1
Power struggles followed.,1
Mayer and Disney TV studio head Peter Rice fought about who had the authority to decide which shows aired on Disney+.,1
Rice feared losing greenlight power would affect Disney's relationship with Hollywood.,1
Mayer won the main argument — he would have greenlight power for Disney+.,1
"Mayer left Disney in 2020 to become TikTok's CEO, months after Iger chose Chapek as CEO.",1
Mayer and Rice declined to comment for this story.,1
"While Chapek didn't consult Iger about his October 2020 reorganization, he did cite many of the same principles that Kyncl and Iger discussed in 2018.",1
"""Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it,"" Chapek said in a statement announcing the changes.",1
"When he became CEO, Chapek went on a listening tour of executives to find out what was working and what wasn't.",1
Chapek decided to reverse Iger's decision to have greenlighting authority rest with the head of the streaming services.,1
"He gave that power back to content heads, who have more money than ever before to make programming — Disney plans to spend a record $33 billion on content for fiscal 2022.",1
"But with Daniel getting P&L control, long-term Disney executives also lost the ability to run the businesses of their own divisions.",1
"Kelly Campbell's decision to leave her job running Hulu to lead NBCUniversal's Peacock in October was at least partially motivated by her desire to have more control over a business than what Disney allowed her, according to a person familiar with her thinking.",1
Campbell declined to comment for this story.,1
"One film executive told CNBC that Disney operated smoothly when Alan Bergman, chairman of Disney Studios, and Alan Horn, former chief creative officer of Disney Studios, were in charge of the studio's P&L.",1
"Film producers knew standard facts, such as a movie's marketing budget or a film's release date.",0
"In the new world, with Daniel in charge, it's much harder to find out answers because the creative point people simply don't know, the person said.",1
Others saw Chapek's restructuring as simply pushing the envelope on a trend Iger already started —making it clear to Wall Street that streaming was the company's new priority.,1
"By putting Daniel in charge of a variety of different budgets, Chapek could more easily steer all of Disney in the same direction.",1
"This month, Disney put its new Pixar movie ""Turning Red"" directly on Disney+ instead of in theaters first.",1
"That decision would have taken ""months"" under Iger's structure, with division heads flexing their power and knowledge of the market, according to three people who participated in the discussions.",1
"Instead, the debate took weeks, with Pixar executives ultimately agreeing that the movie should go to Disney+ first, the people said.",1
"As with any corporate reorganization, the proof will be in the results.",1
"Disney has a target of 230 million to 260 million global Disney+ subscribers by the end of 2024, compared with about 130 million Disney+ subscribers today.",1
"If Disney can get there, Chapek and Daniel can claim success — assuming they also revive the company's shares, which have fallen about 30% in the past 52 weeks, even as crowds have returned to Disney's theme parks around the world.",1
Disney routinely outspends all other global companies by billions of dollars a year on entertainment content.,0
The former CEO felt stripping division heads of their budget control wasn't the right structure for Disney because the company was too diverse and complex.,1
"He's demanding of his direct reports and holds them accountable, the people said.",1
"Daniel is Black, an extreme rarity among the primary leaders of global media companies.",1
He's the first Black senior executive ever to report directly to the Disney CEO in the history of the company.,1
"That carries weight with certain employees, who respect the symbolism of a minority leader in such a high-profile role.",1
"He's been close to Chapek for two decades, first working for him as an MBA intern in 2002.",1
"When Daniel moved to corporate strategy, he again worked with Chapek on a variety of projects in 2007 and 2008.",1
"He worked under Chapek in distribution for Walt Disney Studios in 2009, when he was part of the M&A team that bought Marvel Entertainment, before following him to consumer products in 2011.",1
"Chapek was particularly impressed with Daniel's consumer focus when the two worked together to shorten the theatrical window from four months to three months at the end of 2009, according to a person familiar with the matter.",1
But some of the same people who note Daniel's strengths also told CNBC the job may be too big for him — or almost anyone.,1
"""He arguably has the most important job at Walt Disney, outside of CEO, and he has almost no experience running any of these businesses that were previously run by people that had decades of experience,"" said one former coworker.",1
"Chapek disagrees with that assessment, according to a person familiar with his thinking.",1
"He understands the job is massive in scope but feels that Daniel is suited to handle it given his varied experiences at Disney, including as president of consumer products, games and publishing, and president of operations at Walt Disney Imagineering.",1
"Since his promotion announcement in October 2020, Daniel hasn't done any published or televised interviews.",1
He declined to comment for this story.,1
"Ideally, Chapek would like consumers to experience a more unified digital Disney experience, whether it's logging into Disney+ or buying merchandise from the online Disney store or managing theme park experiences with Disney's Genie service, which is a kind of digital concierge.",1
"ATLANTA, Oct. 20, 2015 ­/PRNewswire/ -- Southern Company Chief Financial Officer Art P. Beattie announced that Daniel S. Tucker has been elected treasurer of Southern Company.",1
"Currently serving as senior vice president of finance, Tucker recently assumed responsibility for the treasury, trust finance, enterprise risk management and insurance functions, in addition to his previous responsibilities for investor relations and financial planning.",1
