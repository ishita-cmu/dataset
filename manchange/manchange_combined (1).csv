The announced changes come days after reports circulated that Peloton could soon be a takeover target. Shares surged on hopes of a deal would be struck with a tech giant or athletic apparel behemoth. But news of a management shakeup and strategic overhaul make this path seem much less likely, at least in the near term. The connected fitness company announced Tuesday that Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, will become CEO and president and join Pelotons board. McCarthy, 68, currently serves on the board of delivery start-up Instacart. Founder John Foley will step down from the CEO post, and become executive chairman of the board. Peloton shares closed Monday up more than 25%, at $37.27, bringing the companys market cap back up to about $12.2 billion. ""Since founding Peloton a decade ago, weve grown this brand to engage and motivate a loyal community of more than 6.6 million members,"" said Foley, in a press release announcing the leadership changes. ""Im incredibly proud to have worked with such talented teammates over the years who have helped me build Peloton into what it is today, and Im confident that Barry is the right leader to take the company into its next phase of growth."" Foley pointed to McCarthys previous experience managing subscription business models and digital streaming companies. Hes also been a consultant for Peloton investor Technology Crossover Ventures.Cost cuts across the businessThe news of Foley stepping down, along with other cost-cutting measures, came ahead of the release of Pelotons fiscal second-quarter results. In January, Peloton reported preliminary quarterly revenue and subscriber figures, but Tuesdays announcement also included a lower forecast for the year. Peloton now anticipates fiscal 2022 revenue within a range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, down from prior expectations of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion.The company also said it will end the year with about 3 million connected fitness subscribers. Previously, it projected it would have 3.35 million to 3.45 million. These are people who own one of Pelotons products and also pay a monthly fee to access its on-demand content. Peloton said it expects to slash roughly $800 million in annual costs and reduce capital expenditures by roughly $150 million this year. It plans to wind down the development of its Peloton Output Park, the $400 million factory that it was building in Ohio. It said it will reduce its delivery teams and the amount of warehouse space it owns and operates. ""The decisions we have made will make us a leaner and more nimble organization that is better able to execute against our sizable growth opportunity,"" said Foley, in a separate letter to shareholders. Peloton is expecting to cut 2,800 jobs, or about 20% of its corporate positions. The cuts wont affect its instructor roster or content. But Foley did announce that his wife, Jill Foley, is leaving her role as vice president of Pelotons apparel business. CNBC reported last month that the division was struggling recently to meet its internal goals. Peloton employed 6,743 people in the United States as of June 30, more than double the roughly 3,281 employees it counted a year earlier, according to annual filings.Activist Blackwells says the moves arent enoughPeloton had ramped up its staffing and manufacturing during the Covid pandemic, when demand for at-home exercise equipment surged. But the company miscalculated how sustainable this trend would be. As consumers became vaccinated, many headed back to gyms and interest for Pelotons equipment slowed. The company also botched how it handled a recall of its treadmills. Roughly a week ago, activist Blackwells Capital — which has a less than 5% stake in the company — sent a letter to Pelotons board urging Foley to quit his role as CEO, and asking the company to consider selling itself. Reports have since circulated that potential suitors could include Amazon or Nike. However, Foley along with other Peloton insiders had a combined voting control of roughly 80% as of Sept. 30, which would make it practically impossible for any deal to go through without their approval. Following Tuesdays news, Blackwells Chief Investment Officer Jason Aintabi said the actions dont go far enough. ""Peloton CEO John Foley naming himself Executive Chairman and hiring a new CFO does not address any of Peloton investors concerns,"" Aintabi said in a statement. ""Mr. Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or Executive Chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done today."" Foley, 51, founded Peloton in 2012. He previously served as the president at Barnes & Noble. Foley also brought on his wife, Jill, to lead up Pelotons apparel business — a decision Blackwells has also criticized. As part of the management changes, William Lynch, Pelotons president, will step down from his executive role but remain a director. Lynch, a former Barnes & Noble CEO, was brought on by Foley in 2017 to help drive growth."

Management Change,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/20/disney-ceo-chapek-iger-falling-out.html,"'Extremely awkward': Bob Chapek and Bob Iger had a falling out, they rarely talk — and the rift looms over Disney's future","In this article DISBob Iger, left, and Bob Chapek of Disney Charley Gallay | Getty Images; Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApril 12, 2020. Thats the day former Disney CEO Bob Igers relationship with his handpicked successor, current Disney CEO Bob Chapek, began to fall apart. Iger had stunned the world in February of that year by resigning as Disneys chief executive, effective immediately. He elevated Chapek, whom Iger and the board had long seen internally as the front-runner for the position given his operational experience and decades at the company. Iger would stick around as executive chairman and direct the companys ""creative endeavors"" to help with the transition. The timing of a CEO change at arguably the worlds most famous entertainment company couldnt have been worse. Just weeks after Iger stepped down, Disney began closing its theme parks around the world during the initial stages of the Covid-19 quarantine. Iger and Chapek seemed to be ready for the pandemic challenge together. ""I cant think of a better person to succeed me in this role,"" Iger said March 11, 2020, during the companys annual shareholder meeting, a day before the company announced it would begin closing its parks. Chapek returned the optimism.A Mouse House divided The pressure is on Disney CEO Bob Chapek, whose contract is up early next year. Some key takeaways: Chapek and CEO Bob Igers relationship soured after Iger gave comments to The New York Times about wanting to help Chapek run the company during the pandemic.Several employees have called Iger to express their dissatisfaction with Chapek over his response to Floridas ""Dont Say Gay"" bill.Chapek centralized budget power under his right-hand man, Kareem Daniel, a move that irritated several Disney veterans – as well as Iger.Like Iger, Chapek and Daniel want to speed up the pace of Disneys digital transformation.""Ive watched Bob [Iger] lead this company to amazing new heights, and Ive learned an enormous amount from that experience,"" Chapek said. One month after those comments, with everyone stuck at home, then-New York Times media columnist Ben Smith published a story after reaching Iger by email. He reported Iger wasnt going to turn Chapek to the wolves as a brand-new CEO while the world was falling apart. Iger told Smith he would stick around to help run the company. ""A crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it, particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!"" Iger said in his email. Chapek was furious when he saw the story, according to three people familiar with the matter. He had not expressed a need or desire for extra help. He wasnt looking for a white knight. Iger had postponed his retirement as CEO three times already. Chapek felt he was essentially doing it again, leaving him as a hapless second banana, according to people familiar with his thoughts. Chapek was already reporting to Iger, the boards chairman, anyway. The Disney board had little interest in starting a brawl, especially given the state of the company and the world, the people said. Three days after Smiths story was published, Disney accelerated its timeline and named Chapek to its board.Bob Iger poses with Mickey Mouse attends Mickeys 90th Spectacular at The Shrine Auditorium on October 6, 2018 in Los Angeles. Valerie Macon | AFP | Getty Images""It was a turning-point moment,"" said one of the people familiar with Chapeks reaction to Igers interview with Smith. Since that incident, Iger and Chapek havent been able to mend their relationship, according to about a dozen people familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC for this story. The people asked to remain anonymous because the relationship and discussions about it are private. In the months that followed, Chapek began making key decisions about Disneys future — including a dramatic reorganization of the company and outing actress Scarlett Johanssons salary following a dispute over her Marvel movie ""Black Widow"" — without Igers input. Internal messages about business strategy from both men would sometimes conflict, as it became clear the executives werent speaking with one voice, several people noted. While much of the public narrative has centered around Igers ""long goodbye"" — he departed as chairman in January — Chapek, 61, has actually been firmly in control of Disney for more than 18 months. Normal times would have allowed Iger and Chapek to work more closely. Instead, the two executives barely spoke to each other. Chapek has a small circle of close confidants with whom he makes major decisions — longtime right-hand man Kareem Daniel, chief of staff Arthur Bochner, and, to some degree, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy, whom Iger promoted to the role in 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. Iger hasnt been part of that circle. Late last year, just weeks before his departure as executive chairman, Iger threw himself a going-away party, inviting more than 50 people at his house in Brentwood, a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood. He spoke at length about his time at Disney in front of the crowd. Chapek attended, but there was little interaction between the two men, according to people who attended the party. Guests — including veteran Disney executives and on-camera talent, such as broadcasters Robin Roberts, David Muir and Al Michaels — sat at two long tables at Igers house. Iger and Chapek sat at opposite tables. Chapek sat near several of his direct reports, including Daniel. Iger sat next to film director and mogul Steven Spielberg. While Iger spent about 10 minutes publicly praising former colleagues, he barely mentioned Chapek, said the people. ""It was extremely awkward,"" said one of the guests, who asked to remain anonymous because the party was private. ""The tension was palpable."" Both Iger and Chapek declined to comment on their relationship with each other.Igers shadowChapeks decision to move away from Iger showed chutzpah, but it also put him on an island against a Disney icon, who also happened to be the chairman of his company and a large shareholder. He also hasnt been able to benefit from the myriad relationships Iger developed from decades at Disney. Anyone succeeding Iger, who had been Disneys CEO since 2005, was going to have a difficult time filling his shoes. Iger was generally beloved by Hollywood and highly respected as a CEO, particularly after orchestrating a series of intellectual property acquisitions — of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm — which will likely go down in media history as three of the smartest deals ever. Iger, 71, has even flirted with running for president of the United States. Chapek, meanwhile, has a harder exterior and at times, according to colleagues, struggles with emotional intelligence — which happens to be Igers strength.Bob Chapek, left, and Bob Iger. Source: CNBCCentralizing Disney leadershipIn October 2020, about eight months after he took over as CEO, Chapek announced Disney was strategically reorganizing its media and entertainment businesses. This was Disneys second major reorganization in less than three years. The key part of the announcement was the following: ""The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content —both distribution and ad sales — and will oversee operations of the Companys streaming services. It will also have sole P&L accountability for Disneys media and entertainment businesses."" Those two sentences upended how Disney has done business for decades. The change gave Daniel, the leader of the new Media and Entertainment Distribution group, called DMED internally, one of the most important jobs in the history of media. The decision was instantly polarizing, leading to a burst of internal frustration among some veteran Disney employees who no longer controlled the budgets of their divisions, according to people familiar with the matter. Chapek wants to streamline Disney so content decisions across distribution platforms can be made in synchrony. Instead of division heads running their own fiefdoms, Chapek and Daniel can steer Disney by controlling the budgets of each group and deciding where content ends up — streaming or cable or broadcast or movie theaters. Executives can then focus on making content, or selling ads, or building streaming technology, with direction from Chapek and Daniel. Historically, the heads of Disney TV or ESPN or Hulu or film would run their entire businesses. Conceptually, Chapeks idea actually isnt all that different from what Iger had begun to put in place with the organization of Disney+. In early 2018, Iger met with Robert Kyncl, chief business officer at Googles YouTube, according to people familiar with the meeting. Before Google, Kyncl had worked for seven years at Netflix, overseeing content partnerships.Robert Kyncl, global head of content at YouTube Inc. Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKyncl told Iger if he wanted Disney to start trading at Netflix-like multiples — which were, at the time, orders of magnitude higher than Disneys — Iger needed to run operations like a technology company. Google separated its content and distribution divisions. The same roles didnt live within smaller groups, the way Disney had been structured for years. Kyncl declined to comment to CNBC about the meeting. If Disney wanted investors to see its burgeoning streaming service as the growth engine in a digital-first world, Iger realized he needed to centralize power around Disney+. According to two people familiar with the meeting, Iger urgently asked then-Disney head of strategy Kevin Mayer to return from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas so Iger could show him a new organizational structure, which he drew on a whiteboard in front of Mayer. Mayer would become the head of Disneys new direct-to-consumer unit, in charge of the companys streaming platforms: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Disney officially reorganized in March 2018. Power struggles followed. Mayer and Disney TV studio head Peter Rice fought about who had the authority to decide which shows aired on Disney+. Rices principal issue was that content executives could no longer have direct conversations with Hollywood talent and tell them whether Disney would make their show or not. Rice feared losing greenlight power would affect Disneys relationship with Hollywood. If studio executives didnt have the power to approve projects, theyd quickly lose credibility with creators, who would want to speak with the people at Disney who possessed that authority.Close-up detail of the Disney+ app icon on an Apple iPhone 12 Pro smartphone screen. Phil Barker | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesIger had to solve the disputes by making control decisions on the fly. Mayer won the main argument — he would have greenlight power for Disney+. Mayer left Disney in 2020 to become TikToks CEO, months after Iger chose Chapek as CEO. Mayer and Rice declined to comment for this story. While Chapek didnt consult Iger about his October 2020 reorganization, he did cite many of the same principles that Kyncl and Iger discussed in 2018. ""Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it,"" Chapek said in a statement announcing the changes. When he became CEO, Chapek went on a listening tour of executives to find out what was working and what wasnt. He heard from both distribution and content executives that the current arrangement had become dysfunctional. Chapek decided to reverse Igers decision to have greenlighting authority rest with the head of the streaming services. He gave that power back to content heads, who have more money than ever before to make programming — Disney plans to spend a record $33 billion on content for fiscal 2022. Thats largely pleased Disneys content leaders, who can now tell creators directly whether Disney will work with them, according to people familiar with the matter. But with Daniel getting P&L control, long-term Disney executives also lost the ability to run the businesses of their own divisions. Some creative leaders didnt mind, preferring to focus on making content rather than selling advertising or working on wholesale distribution agreements with pay-TV providers. Others didnt appreciate their loss of control over budgets. Kelly Campbells decision to leave her job running Hulu to lead NBCUniversals Peacock in October was at least partially motivated by her desire to have more control over a business than what Disney allowed her, according to a person familiar with her thinking. Campbell declined to comment for this story. One film executive told CNBC that Disney operated smoothly when Alan Bergman, chairman of Disney Studios, and Alan Horn, former chief creative officer of Disney Studios, were in charge of the studios P&L. Film producers knew standard facts, such as a movies marketing budget or a films release date. In the new world, with Daniel in charge, its much harder to find out answers because the creative point people simply dont know, the person said. Others saw Chapeks restructuring as simply pushing the envelope on a trend Iger already started —making it clear to Wall Street that streaming was the companys new priority. By putting Daniel in charge of a variety of different budgets, Chapek could more easily steer all of Disney in the same direction. Decisions could be made more quickly. This month, Disney put its new Pixar movie ""Turning Red"" directly on Disney+ instead of in theaters first. That decision would have taken ""months"" under Igers structure, with division heads flexing their power and knowledge of the market, according to three people who participated in the discussions. Instead, the debate took weeks, with Pixar executives ultimately agreeing that the movie should go to Disney+ first, the people said. ""Turning Red"" is the No. 1 film premiere on Disney+ globally to date, based on number of hours watched in the first three days. As with any corporate reorganization, the proof will be in the results. Disney has a target of 230 million to 260 million global Disney+ subscribers by the end of 2024, compared with about 130 million Disney+ subscribers today. If Disney can get there, Chapek and Daniel can claim success — assuming they also revive the companys shares, which have fallen about 30% in the past 52 weeks, even as crowds have returned to Disneys theme parks around the world.Kareem DanielDaniels P&L oversight for all movie, TV and film distribution, advertising, sales, technology and other divisions — jobs that used to be done by a cadre of Disney employees with 20 or 30 years experience each — gives him one of the most powerful jobs ever created in media. Disneys fiscal 2021 revenue topped $67 billion and has a market capitalization of about $240 billion. Disney routinely outspends all other global companies by billions of dollars a year on entertainment content.Kareem Daniel Source: Business WireIger never agreed with giving Daniel so much control. The former CEO felt stripping division heads of their budget control wasnt the right structure for Disney because the company was too diverse and complex. Daniel is a polarizing figure among colleagues who have worked with him. Hes described by five former and current co-workers as smart, hard-working and gregarious. He studied electrical engineering and got an MBA from Stanford. Hell slap peoples backs and is fun to engage with outside of work, three of the people said. Hes demanding of his direct reports and holds them accountable, the people said. Daniel is Black, an extreme rarity among the primary leaders of global media companies. Hes the first Black senior executive ever to report directly to the Disney CEO in the history of the company. That carries weight with certain employees, who respect the symbolism of a minority leader in such a high-profile role. Like Chapek, Daniel has worked in a variety of Disney units, including studio distribution, consumer products, games and publishing, Walt Disney Imagineering, and corporate strategy. Hes been close to Chapek for two decades, first working for him as an MBA intern in 2002. When Daniel moved to corporate strategy, he again worked with Chapek on a variety of projects in 2007 and 2008. He worked under Chapek in distribution for Walt Disney Studios in 2009, when he was part of the M&A team that bought Marvel Entertainment, before following him to consumer products in 2011. Chapek was particularly impressed with Daniels consumer focus when the two worked together to shorten the theatrical window from four months to three months at the end of 2009, according to a person familiar with the matter. But some of the same people who note Daniels strengths also told CNBC the job may be too big for him — or almost anyone. ""He arguably has the most important job at Walt Disney, outside of CEO, and he has almost no experience running any of these businesses that were previously run by people that had decades of experience,"" said one former coworker. Chapek disagrees with that assessment, according to a person familiar with his thinking.

Tanski, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel Gas Company, has indicated his intention to retire, effective July 1, 2019, after more than 40 years of service.

For the first time in nearly 60 years, the U.S. is a net exporter of natural gas and our utility customers are paying the lowest rates in decades because they are next door to the largest natural gas producing region in North America. While much has changed, one thing has remained constant: the dedication of National Fuel and its current 2,100 employees to finding, transporting and delivering much-needed, clean-burning natural gas supplies safely and reliably to utility customers and others throughout our regional pipeline network. I will be leaving the Company in capable hands that are well prepared and committed to building value for our communities and our shareholders.”“National Fuel is in an excellent position for the future,” said Chairman of the Board David F. Smith. “During his tenure as President and CEO, Ron has continued our legacy of tremendous leadership, long-term focus, deliberate decision making, and financial discipline, resulting in ongoing growth and value for the Company and benefits for shareholders.

We are fortunate to have a talent of Dave Bauer’s caliber as Ron’s successor, and the board and I look forward to continued success with Dave at the helm of our experienced executive team.”"

It must embrace radical reform,"In summary Without a radical change to the corporate culture, a hard to swallow dose of transparency and all-hands-on-deck fire prevention effort, the next PG&E-sparked wildfire will mean a Titanic ending to the company.By Dean FlorezDean Florez is a California Air Resources Board member, and a former state senator from Shafter, senatordeanflorez@yahoo.com. He wrote this commentary for CALmatters.In the effort to fend off radical restructuring, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. put in place a chief executive officer who was the highest paid federal employee in the nation, and new members of its board of directors who will put profits over the interests of the people.PG&E cannot take half measures. It must fundamentally reform and put the health and safety of Californians first.Where to begin?First, PG&E’s leadership needs to rebuild trust with taxpayers, ratepayers and shareholders.As U.S. District Judge William Alsup, overseeing the criminal case over the San Bruno gas line explosion, recently said: “PG&E pumped out $4.5 billion in dividends and let the tree budget wither.”This is nothing short of a scandal, and the dynamic needs to be reversed immediately. There needs to be a moratorium on corporate dividends and executive bonuses until the utility gets a clean bill of health from independent health and safety experts.PG&E needs to welcome radical–and sometimes ugly–transparency. Californians deserve the truth.The utility must commit to making public all that went wrong under the previous leadership. If it takes a truth and reconciliation commission, then so be it. The company must surface all the critical memos, all the unpleasantness. We need to know how deep the mismanagement, corruption and incompetence goes.PG&E’s leadership must do everything in its power to prevent the next fire and the loss of life and property associated with it.Business as usual must end. Trees and vegetation need to come down now. Gov. Gavin Newsom may need to declare a state of emergency that will allow PG&E and local governments to access state resources to get the job done before the next Camp Fire breaks out.This could include bringing to bear the national guard, the conservation corps, and perhaps prisoner-workers. The state could carry the initial costs with PG&E shareholders reimbursing later.The fundamental point is this: the work cannot be delayed.California bears some responsibility. A weak-kneed California Public Utilities Commission allowed PG&E to operate as it did. There are no innocents here.New management must commit to changing the culture of the organization. PG&E today is a lumbering bureaucracy, where change is difficult and new ideas are often punished. I know that first hand from holding more than few oversight hearings when I was in the Legislature.Changing the culture can begin with simple steps:Get rid of the corporate jet.No more luxury hotels stays and lavish expense accounts.Slap a moratorium on campaign donations.Longer-term, PG&E must commit to a full-fledged modernization effort. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, near the heart of Silicon Valley, and yet it appears to be immune to innovation.The utility must look to the best practices of its peers, and embrace transformative technologies, a commitment to renewable power, and addressing global warming. It must commit to a process of transformation that will change it into the most innovate utility in the world, from being the poster child for what not to do.PG&E’s management change represents a missed opportunity that should make us all concerned. The company has yet to realize the lessons of its past.Without a radical change to the corporate culture, a hard to swallow dose of transparency and all-hands-on-deck fire prevention effort, the next PG&E-sparked wildfire will mean a Titanic ending to the company."

Management Change,https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/21/2466349/0/en/Changes-in-AS-Admirals-Group-Management-Board.html,UPDATE 1-Westfield mall owner Unibail replaces CEO as investors push for European focus,"(Adds shares, details on management changes)PARIS, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Shopping mall group Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) replaced its CEO, just weeks after a small group of rebel investors scored a surprise victory in their campaign for a radical strategy shift.The company said late on Wednesday that the supervisory board had appointed Jean-Marie Tritant, who runs the group’s U.S. business and has been at the company for 20 years, as the new CEO and chair of the management board.Current CEO Christophe Cuvillier, who has been in the post since 2013, would stay in the role until Jan. 1, the company said.French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel teamed up last month with URW’s former boss Leon Bressler to oppose the company’s planned 3.5 billion euro ($4.2 billion) rights issue, which shareholders finally rejected on Nov. 10.The rebel investor consortium, which owns just under 5% of URW’s shares, gathered rapid backing for its campaign, which includes a push to unwind the company’s 2017 acquisition of Westfield by selling off some Westfield assets in the United States and refocusing on Europe.Niel and Bressler, who gained board seats in the process, argued the capital hike was highly dilutive and blamed the Westfield purchase for Unibail’s heavy debt.Cuvillier had called for the rights issue as a means of protecting URW’s credit ratings.URW counts leading European malls such as the Forum des Halles in Paris, Madrid’s La Vaguada and Westfield malls in London among its assets.The coronavirus pandemic has hammered retailers that have been forced to close on and off this year, with a knock-on effect on rental income for shopping mall owners.Bressler, who was chairman and chief executive of Unibail from 1992 to 2006, was elected last week to head up URW’s supervisory board.URW shares, which have lost nearly 60% this year, had jumped 12% on Monday on reports of a broad management shake-up. They were 2.6% lower in early trading on Thursday.Analysts at Berenberg said in a note that pressure on rents and valuations for shopping centres would continue despite hopes emerging for COVID-19 vaccines, adding they were awaiting details of URW’s new strategy.
