"- Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday announced the parent company's name is being changed to ""Meta"" to represent a future beyond just its troubled social network.",1
"The new handle comes as the social media giant tries to fend off one its worst crises yet and pivot to its ambitions for the ""metaverse"" virtual reality version of the internet that the tech giant sees as the future.",1
"Mark Bayer, president of Bayer Strategic Consulting, noted that, “A name change now—when Facebook is under intense scrutiny—reinforces the perception the company is trying to elude responsibility for its lengthening list of misdeeds.",1
"Even if disconnected from the current crisis, the name change will be seen as a clumsy PR move.",0
"“Over time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company.",1
“This is interesting because it is an apt example of an often-used marketing tactic to divert attention away from negative publicity by rebranding or introducing a new identity for the company.,1
“We’ve seen other companies like Google do this with the creation of Alphabet.,1
"It will be up to “Meta” and Mark Zuckerberg to prove that this switch wasn’t an obvious crisis communication strategy to divert from the crises plaguing Facebook, and that it backs up its rebranding explanations for the switch with real value for consumers and shareholders,” he concluded.",1
"Facebook will still be Facebook and each week will uncover yet another scandalous thing Zuckerberg & Co. have tried to cover up,” he said.",0
"While there is a long-standing Jewish tradition to rename a person going through life-threatening medical challenges, I don't think Zuckerberg had that in mind.",0
"Name change aside, the company has a lot of work to do to rebuild trust and confidence in consumers and demonstrate that it can really protect privacy while maintaining balanced and fair standards that are applied to everyone, not just select individuals.",1
"Agency, said “Facebook's decision to change the platform's name is a classic redirection to pull attention away from not only what the public perceives, but what every marketing professional knows.",1
It can’t hide or erase the past with a face lift.,0
"“Meta"" actually fits as a name, as it appears they are moving towards a data driven platform and not connecting people.",1
Facebook’s decision to rebrand is an ill-timed move but not for the reason you might think.,1
The author argues that the real problem is that Facebook is re-branding before its vision is a reality.,1
"Right now, social media remains the core of the company’s operations and revenues.",0
"By adopting a brand name that is based on future potential capabilities and a platform and products that, by Zuckerberg’s own admission, may not be offered for a decade, the company sets itself up to confuse people at best; at worst, it will disappoint people and further degrade their trust in the company.",1
Last week Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his company is changing its name to Meta.,1
"The rebrand has been panned for many reasons: it’s a foolish attempt to distract from the criticism the company has recently faced; the metaverse that the new name refers to is not well-known or understood, so it’s confusing; Meta is a stupid company name, etc.",1
"Right now, social media remains the core of the company’s operations and revenues.",0
"By adopting a brand name that is based on future potential capabilities and a platform and products that, by Zuckerberg’s own admission, may not be established for nearly a decade, the company sets itself up to confuse people at best; at worst, it will disappoint people and further degrade their trust in the company.",1
It’s not surprising that Facebook would take this tact; many companies do.,1
"When business leaders want to change their company’s identity or reposition their business, they often turn to external messaging and communications first — a new name, a fresh logo, an advertising campaign.",1
There might have been a time in the past when a corporate makeover was effective at changing public opinion.,1
"By adopting a new name, Facebook may be trying to claim that it is developing innovative technologies that bring people together in new and exciting ways.",1
"It should have waited until it addressed these problems, and more importantly, established itself as a provider of metaverse products or applications before announcing a new brand.",1
That’s what Google did when its corporate entity was rebranded to Alphabet in 2015.,1
"Over many years leading up the change, Google’s business had expanded well beyond its search engine product.",1
"When the company adopted its new name, it had already become a tech conglomerate comprised of a wide range of companies and products including driverless cars, medical devices, and smart home appliances.",1
"As a result, the brand change not only made sense, but it also effectively minimized the associations between Google and its sister companies, shielding Google from concerns from the public raised about emerging technologies (“creepy” drones, dangerous autonomous vehicles, etc.)",1
and shielding the other entities from the profit expectations of Wall Street placed on Google.,1
"Despite its new name, Facebook cannot effectively create any separation between its social media business and the metaverse and other developments because the latter are only in their infancy.",1
"Of course, not all companies rely on name changes to repair their public images.",0
Consider Microsoft’s transformation.,1
"When CEO Satya Nadella set out to remake the company and address its critics, the company embraced AI, mobile, and cloud-first strategies; opened itself up to partnerships (e.g., Linux); aggressively pursued acquisitions (e.g., LinkedIn); and implemented digital transformation across its operations.",1
"And yet, Microsoft hasn’t felt the need to change its name or launch any kind of corporate campaign to promote the changes.",1
"Instead, it has relied on its operational and culture changes to resurrect its business and shift public opinion.",1
"With its rebranding effort, Facebook is making promises that it doesn’t seem able to deliver right now.",1
"The company was a manufacturer of potentially addictive opiate painkillers, a business it discontinued entirely in the United States last year.",1
"Johnson & Johnson, like other medical companies, has weathered its share of reputation-threatening controversies.",0
The company regained public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging.,1
"Throughout, the company has relied on the “halo effect” created by popular consumer products, none more so than its Johnson’s Baby line of shampoos, lotions, moisturizers and powder for infants.",0
"“It gives us a wonderful image that most companies would kill for,” Ralph S. Larsen, the company’s chairman at the time, told Forbes in 2001.",0
"Even lingering affection for the company’s consumer products does not do much to advance Johnson & Johnson’s medical businesses, which are far more important to the company’s finances.",1
"BlackRock is overhauling its investing strategy to make sustainability the ""new standard for investing,"" which will include launching new active and passively-managed funds that focus on socially responsible investing.",1
"Since the company offers exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500, for example, it's difficult to unilaterally sell stocks of companies that engage in activities that might not align with a customer's values.",0
"In 2018 he said that companies must focus on more than just making money, and in 2019 he argued that companies need to take positions on societal issues.",1
"This time around, his letter feels more immediate, since the company also announced a host of new initiatives, including doubling its exchange traded funds, or ETF's, that focus on companies' environmental, social and governance factors, or ESG.",1
The firm is also moving away from thermal coal companies.,1
"""Because sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, we are making sustainability integral to the way BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies,"" the firm's global executive committee, which includes Fink, wrote in its letter to clients Tuesday.",1
"Instead of optimizing for market cap-weighted exposure, these funds will instead focus on ESG-optimized exposure.",1
"The company also plans to expand its offerings of sustainability-focused passive funds, as well as its impact investing arm.",1
"""As the largest investment firm in the world, it was very clear to me that more and more clients are looking for advice from us,"" Fink said.",0
"""Probably the most important inference from my observations is I believe we are just beginning a major reallocation of capital.""",1
"As ESG-focused investing has grown in popularity so, too, have critics of the style, who argue that the inherently subjective nature means there's little accountability.",0
"The company said it's divesting from companies that generate more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production — or coal used for power production — from its actively managed portfolio, which it hopes to complete by the middle of 2020.",1
"This extends to the firm's alternative business, which BlackRock said will make no future direct investments in companies focused on thermal coal production.",1
"This includes sustainable versions of the firm's flagship index products, and there will also be options to screen out specific sectors entirely.",0
"Unilever simplifies organisation London, 25 January 2022.",1
"Unilever today announced changes to its organisational model to make it a simpler, more category-focused business.",1

"Each Business Group will be fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth, and profit delivery globally.",1

A lean Unilever Corporate Centre will continue to set Unilever’s overall strategy.,1
"As a result of the new set-up, Unilever is making changes to its leadership team.",1
"Fernando Fernandez, EVP Latin America, has been appointed President Beauty & Wellbeing, which includes Hair Care, Skin Care, as well as Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements, and Unilever Prestige.",1
"Fabian Garcia, President North America, has been appointed President Personal Care, responsible for Skin Cleansing, Deodorants, and Oral Care.",1

"Reginaldo Ecclissato, Chief Supply Chain Officer, will lead the Supply Chain and Unilever Business Operations as Chief Business Operations Officer.",1
"Sunny Jain, President Beauty & Personal Care, has decided to leave Unilever to set up an investment fund in technology megatrends.",1

CHICAGO – When Miguel Patricio took over as chief executive officer of the Kraft Heinz Co. he sought to turn the company around by realigning its product portfolio and using its scale to improve results.,1
"Now Kraft Heinz is entering phase three of his strategy and plans to embed agility into the organization with digital technologies that will improve customer service, innovation and marketing initiatives.",1
"“The first two phases of our transformation were designed to bring scale and agility together,” Mr. Patricio said Feb. 22 during a presentation at the virtual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.",1
"“We focused on capabilities, processes and disciplines that, in many ways, were new to Kraft Heinz, but not necessarily new to the world.",1
"“In other words, we are building a more powerful engine to supercharge our operating model,” Mr. Patricio said.",1
Agile@Scale is how we will go about opening new growth opportunities and unlocking greater efficiencies.,1
"Just Spices is a manufacturer of spices, spice blends, salad dressings and meal kits, and approximately 70% of the company’s sales are direct-to-consumer.",1
"“Just Spices brings a proven AI (artificial intelligence) solution and differentiated approach to spices with a focus on recipes and (that targets) younger consumers through a fully integrated direct-to-consumer marketplace,” Mr. Abrams-Rivera said.",1
"“We are creating a much deeper and granular level of understanding of our consumers, who they are, their needs and their behaviors,” Mr. Abrams-Rivera said.",1
Mr. Abrams-Rivera said that one year ago Kraft Heinz was managing between 60% and 70% variability in its shipments.,1
"“As a solution, we created a Kraft Heinz proprietary ecosystem to design the perfect shipment.",1
"The first step was to ingest approximately 50 data sources, aggregating internal data, like historical inventory turnover, trade promotions and sales activity, alongside external data, such macroeconomic factors like weather to create demand planning view all the way down to the store and SKU (stock-keeping unit) level.",1
"Change is never easy, and when you’re a 112-year-old enterprise like Walgreen Company (“Walgreens”), it’s even less so.",1
That was our business strategy.,0
"We called it “seven by 10,” meaning we wanted to have 7,000 stores by 2010.",1
"In fact, we beat that goal—going from 4,250 stores in 2003 to 7,000 in 2009.",1
"To support the seven-by-10 strategy, we had some well-refined capabilities.",1
"For example, we were very good at managing real estate, including construction and analytics.",0
The old Walgreens business strategy required a command-and-control approach to leadership.,1
But then the competitive landscape changed.,1
"New rivals entered the market, such as third-party pharmacy benefits management companies that deliver prescriptions by mail.",1
More grocers started offering in-store pharmacies.,1
"An even bigger challenge was the growth of Internet pure plays, like Amazon and Google, which sell most of what we carry.",1
All of these had the potential to lure customers out of our stores.,1
"At the same time, we started to see significant changes in healthcare, which ultimately resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the advent of accountable care organizations.",0
"Throw in the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we knew we had to change our strategy.",1
"In this new market, with the huge push to improve quality and reduce overall healthcare costs, Walgreens had a significant opportunity to become a player in the healthcare value chain.",1
"As a result, we evolved from simply filling prescriptions for people to becoming a single point of patient care, and a destination for health and daily-living products and services for our customers.",1
"To succeed in this new role, we had to change our business strategy.",1
"Instead of relying on a real estate play—location, location, location—we focused on improving the customer experience.",1
"As our strategy evolved and our focus changed from opening stores to delivering an exceptional customer experience, we recognized that not only was the command-and-control approach outdated, but it also prevented us from getting the best from our people.",1
It’s strange—people have an emotional connection to a cup of coffee.,0
This represented a fundamental change in how we engaged with our market.,1
We wanted to be more than a simple retail chain—we wanted to be an experience provider.,1
"To execute that strategy, however, we needed to redesign some components of the organization.",1
We had to focus our frontline and field leadership on coaching employees and creating the right customer interactions.,1
"We’d clearly need to redefine roles, but we also knew that some of our incentives weren’t aligned with the new behaviors we wanted among the field employees.",1
"Next came incentives; we had to change the way that we motivated and rewarded people, to emphasize employee engagement and customer satisfaction.",1
"Given that each district manager oversees almost 1,000 people, managing, developing, and operating the business can be a challenge.",0
"We had recognized years before that although Walgreens had centralized processes for functions including HR, IT, employee relations, and finance, we couldn’t make all those decisions at the corporate level.",1
"First, for each of our 30 U.S. markets, we created a position called vice president for markets, located in the field (the local geography).",1
We did this to move corporate-level leadership closer to the customer.,1
"To support them, and to bring market-level resources closer to the customer’s experience, we also moved functions such as HR, IT, real estate, employee relations, and finance to the field.",1
"Along with these departments, we gave every market its own profit and loss responsibility.",1
This really drove accountability at the local level.,0
We had tried to improve customer service in the past.,0
So we moved some decisions that had been located within the field management structure higher up.,1
"With this adjustment, managers have more time to work on the company’s new priorities—employee engagement and improving the customer experience.",1
"Another goal was to develop management skills at the store level, so those people could make solid decisions that were right for their community.",0
"Some are swamped in the morning, for example, and some don’t have their first customer until 11 o’clock.",0
"Now, the way we do things is different.",1
"At the store level, we don’t want employees to simply complete tasks.",1
We based our bonus and advancement system purely on financial performance—meaning how sales and profit numbers matched expectations.,0
"With this shift, we set up a true pay-for-performance system, including incentives to drive the behaviors we wanted.",1
Leadership at Walgreens today carries a different expectation and is rewarded accordingly.,1
There’s also a percentage that accounts for community engagement and events.,0
There’s another component to accountability: managing underperformers.,0
We hadn’t had those policies in place before.,1
"We’re clear about the new expectations regarding the treatment of customers, and we’re training employees to meet those standards.",1
"For instance, we instituted five-minute meetings every day, in every store.",1
"If we provide the right training and leadership, the store managers and employees will come up with the answers they need on their own—the right solution for their location and market.",1
"We also implemented “store walks,” in which market vice presidents and district managers visit stores in their markets and determine what’s working well and what’s not.",1
"One of the questions in our employee engagement survey is “Do you have a best friend at work?” We want that kind of social connection, because it’s a big part of how our employees grow and remain engaged, which translates to a better experience for our customers, and for them.",0
But they worked so well in the pilot that we rolled them out to the entire company.,1
"We think next year will be even better—everyone now understands the larger strategy, we have targets in place, and company bonuses will be awarded against those targets.",1
"For example, we used to expect our store clerks to be efficient.",0
Now we encourage them to cultivate the kind of friendliness that will attract customers.,1

"Peloton's new chief executive, Barry McCarthy, has only been at the helm of the connected fitness company for about a month.",1
But he's already testing ways to lure new customers and make the business more profitable.,1
"Peloton confirmed to CNBC that on Friday it will start to trial a new pricing system, where customers pay a single monthly fee for both their workout equipment and for access to Peloton's on-demand fitness classes.",1
"Should a user choose to cancel, Peloton would take back the Bike.",1
"Customers will only be able to choose this option through Peloton's brick-and-mortar stores, or its fitness studios, and not online.",1
"Peloton also announced Thursday that it has hired Andrew Rendich, former chief operating officer of the e-commerce company Grove Collaborative, as its chief supply chain officer, effective next week.",1
The company is trying to win over skeptical investors.,1
At least one Wall Street analyst has already questioned whether the new pricing plan could end up weighing on Peloton's brand and finances.,1
Peloton spokeswoman Amelise Lane said Peloton created the limited-time pilot in select markets in the United States to explore various pricing models and options for new members.,1
"""This aligns with Peloton's belief that intuition drives testing and data drives decision making as the company sets course for the next phase of its evolution and growth,"" Lane said in an emailed statement.",1
The bigger upfront expense comes with the company's equipment.,0
"Peloton's original Bike currently costs $1,745, including delivery and setup fees, while its Bike+ retails for $2,495.",1
"The company last August had cut the price of its Bike by about 20% to $1,495, not including delivery, hoping to appeal to more consumers with a cheaper option.",1
"McCarthy has already made it very clear, too, that prices could fall further as he aims to grow Peloton's user base beyond the Covid pandemic.",1
"The former Netflix and Spotify exec, who took over the CEO role from Peloton co-founder John Foley, has been tasked with getting Peloton back to profitability, as the company grapples with waning demand for at-home workout products and heightened supply chain expenses.",1
"""I think there's enormous opportunity for us to flex the business model and dramatically increase the [total addressable market] for new members by lowering the cost of entry and playing around with the relationship between the monthly recurring revenue and the upfront revenue,"" McCarthy said in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer last month.",1
"While the bundled pricing strategy is only a test, and it's unclear if and when Peloton would incorporate this idea permanently, BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel raised questions about the damage it could do to Peloton's financials and to its brand image.",1
"""For a company that has been plagued with logistic issues, they are now effectively allowing people to return their piece of equipment, at a moment's notice,"" Siegel said.",1
"""They're actually throwing themselves more into the delivery and logistics game.",1
Peloton's average net monthly connected fitness churn was 0.79% in the latest period.,0
"""Does Peloton become a winter experience for customers who every year rent the bike for four months, and then give it back when the weather's nice?",1
"One user also asked in a Reddit thread about the pricing test if Peloton would, as a result, change the membership fee for people who already own the company's equipment.",1
"As of Dec. 31, Peloton counted 2.77 million connected fitness subscribers.",0
"In another bid to win customers, Peloton recently extended its free at-home trial for its Bike, Bike+ and Tread machines to 100 days from 30.",1
"The company also has new cardio products on the way, including a strength training device called Peloton Guide and a rowing machine.",1
"By manufacturing a suite of connected fitness options, Peloton aims to be a tougher competitor to rivals such as Hydrow, Tonal and Lululemon's Mirror.",1
"Its hope is that people who already own a Bike or a Tread will buy more stuff within the Peloton ecosystem, including its own apparel.",1
"When McCarthy took over as CEO, he wrote in a memo to employees that Peloton had to find ways to drive growth.",1
"While the company has consistently churned out big hits, such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Squid Game,"" Netflix is rethinking many of the philosophies that disrupted the industry more than a decade ago.",1
"The change in strategy, even on the margins, is a surprising one for a company best known for disrupting two industries — first video rental and then cable TV.",1
"Instead of inventing new ways to upend what's become a crowded streaming video industry, Netflix is reconsidering nearly all of the ways it stood out from legacy media companies in the first place.",1
"In other words, Hastings has decided his best strategy now is to un-disrupt.",1
"""It's notable that Netflix is seeking growth by rethinking many of its firmly held beliefs,"" said Joel Mier, Netflix's director of marketing from 1999 to 2006 and a lecturer in marketing at the University of Richmond.",1
"""These decisions will clearly help revenue and subscriber growth in the short- to mid-term.",1
"""Then you realize you have to rip that revenue away from other places because the total ad market isn't growing, and in fact right now it's shrinking.",1
"It's hand-to-hand combat to get people to spend less on, you know, ABC and to spend more on Netflix.",1
"So I would say our subscription-focused strategy's worked pretty well.""",1
Netflix is no longer more than $500 a share.,1
"Since making that comment in 2020, Hastings has watched other streaming services, including Warner Bros.",1
"Discovery's HBO Max, NBCUniversal's Peacock and Paramount Global's Paramount+, launch lower-priced services with ads without a consumer backlash.",1
Disney plans to unveil a cheaper ad-supported Disney+ later this year.,1
"An ad-supported Netflix ""makes a lot of sense"" for ""consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising tolerant,"" he said.",1
Netflix has previously argued it found a gap in the market by not worrying about advertising.,1
"Niche shows, which wouldn't play well with advertisers, who want scale, could be valuable for Netflix if they brought in enough subscribers relative to production budgets.",1
It remains to be seen whether Netflix will offer its full slate of content on an ad-supported service or if certain shows will be walled off for no-ad subscribers only.,1
Other streamers have followed suit after seeing Netflix attract A-list talent by skipping pilots.,1
"Show creators would ask us, 'Do you want to see notes?",0
"Creators were gobsmacked.""",0
"Ordering projects straight to series gave writers and producers certainty and, frequently, more money.",1
Deadline noted 47 different examples of Netflix ordering straight to series in 2020-21 and 20 for 2022.,0
"Netflix plans to start ordering more pilots and slow down on its straight-to-series development process, according to people familiar with the matter.",1
The hope is the end result will lead to higher-quality programming and less fluff.,0
Netflix doesn't plan to lower its overall budget on content.,1
"Still, it does intend to reallocate money to focus on quality after years of adding quantity to fill its library, the people said.",1
Executives have added more original programming in recent years to avoid a lasting reliance on licensed content — much of which has been pulled back by the media companies who own it to fill their own streaming services.,1
"""The move away from appointment television is enormous.",1
"Read more: Netflix's binge-release model is under new scrutiny ""We fundamentally believe that we want to give our members the choice in how they view,"" Peter Friedlander, Netflix's head of scripted series for U.S. and Canada, said earlier this month.",1
"""And so giving them that option on these scripted series to watch as much as they want to watch when they watch it, is still fundamental to what we want to provide.""",0
"But people familiar with the matter said Netflix will continue to play around with weekly releases for certain types of series, such as reality TV and other shows based on competition.",1
Netflix's resistance to weekly scripted release may be the next thing to go.,1

"""At that time we were not among the bidders, today we would think about it.""",1
"This month, Business Insider reported Netflix has been holding talks with Formula One for months for U.S. broadcast rights.",1
"Adding live sports may give Netflix a new audience base, but it flies in the face of Netflix's recent aversion to spending big money on licensed programming.",1
"In 2017, Netflix's corporate account tweeted ""Love is sharing a password.""",1
"But as Netflix's growth has slowed, executives see password-sharing crackdowns as a new engine to reinvigorate revenue growth.",1

"Over the next year, Netflix plans to charge accounts that are clearly shared with users outside the home additional fees.",1
"""We're not trying to shut down that sharing, but we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her and so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing,"" Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said during the same call, adding it will ""allow us to bring in revenue for everyone who's viewing and who gets value from the entertainment that we're offering.""",1
CNBC reported earlier on how the password-sharing crackdown is likely to work.,1
Netflix has benefited from being a pure-play streaming company for years.,0
"While other media companies, such as Disney, have lagged because of a conglomerate discount and slow-growing or declining legacy assets, investors have loved Netflix's one-trick pony: streaming growth.",1
Netflix announced last year it's dabbling in video games.,1
Netflix currently has 22 video games on its platform and aims to have 50 by year end.,1

"Boeing is overhauling some of its management structure in an effort to streamline and integrate functions, improve cost efficiency and better prepare the company to succeed after the coronavirus pandemic.",1
"“We will recover from this crisis, but positioning ourselves now for what will be a significantly smaller, and more competitive, industry after the pandemic subsides requires us to resize, reshape and continuously review our business – starting at the top with our leadership structure,” says a Boeing official.",1
"The overhaul, announced 21 April, includes formation of a new group called “Enterprise Operations, Finance and Strategy”.",1
That division will be led by chief financial officer Greg Smith and tasked with streamlining Boeing’s operation and improving productivity and supply chain health.,1
"Boeing senior vice-president of manufacturing, supply chain and operations Jenette Ramos will take on a “special assignment in support” of Smith’s new group.",1
"“This new global organisation will embed operational excellence and consistent lean principles across Boeing and its supply chain, and restore production and supply chain health as Boeing and the broader aerospace industry recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Boeing says.",1
"The restructuring will also see Boeing combine its legal and compliance programmes, which include functions such as global trade controls, ethics and business conduct.",1
"Led by Boeing chief legal officer and executive vice-president of global compliance Brett Gerry, the new legal-compliance division will “help the company proactively address new legal and compliance obligations arising from an increasingly complex global regulatory environment”, Boeing says.",1
"Boeing says the changes will simplify its management, improve efficiency and make Boeing’s corporate infrastructure more cost effective.",1
The restructuring follows Calhoun’s announcement earlier this month that Boeing would need to transform to align with an industry changed by the coronavirus.,1
"“When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different.",1
"However, revenue growth turned into revenue decline shortly after the IPO as competition emerged and Groupon's popularity faded.",1
"After several years of declining revenue, Groupon is attempting to turnaround its business by moving away from the heavily discounted coupon vouchers that made it famous toward a less discount-driven user experience that encourages more habitual use.",1
Groupon is also investing in partnerships to increase the number of deals available on its platform.,1
Will these changes stem Groupon's declining sales and keep the platform relevant?,1
"Recently, however, the company has introduced card-linked deals and booking requirements that allow for a more seamless user experience.",1
"By making Groupon easier to use, the company hopes that customers will use the platform more frequently.",1
The company introduced card-linked deals in 2018.,1
This new way to use Groupon requires customers to link a credit card to their Groupon account to get cash back after they buy a good or service advertised on the platform.,1
"Unlike Groupon's legacy voucher model, customers taking advantage of card-linked deals don't pay until the point of service and can use deals an unlimited number of times (as long as the deal is still active), but card-linked deals tend to carry smaller discounts than Groupon has typically featured.",1
Groupon has also made changes to its legacy voucher-based coupon product by requiring booking appointments for certain coupon categories.,1
"Booking appointments is in lieu of using a coupon voucher, which aims to create a more natural interaction between customers and businesses.",1
The bottom line is that Groupon has been tweaking its core products to enhance the customer experience and encourage more frequent use.,1
Groupon is probably onto something because it has studied its customer behavior for years and has a good sense for what will improve the platform.,1
Groupon has invested to ensure both sides of its marketplace find value on the platform.,1
"To increase the number of buyers on its platform, the company invested nearly $400 million on marketing last year.",1
"This marketing spend consisted of paid online advertising, such as search engine keywords, as well as offline advertising, such as TV commercials.",0
"In a new effort to increase the number of sellers, Groupon has forged partnerships with other marketplaces.",1
Groupon splits the fees it collects on transactions sourced from marketplace partners.,1
"Although fee-sharing makes these deals less profitable, Groupon is betting that the massive increase in available offerings will make the overall marketplace more worthwhile for consumers.",1
"If there are fewer people browsing for deals, the marketplace will be less lucrative for businesses.",1
"By making investments across both buyers and sellers, Groupon is enhancing the health of its marketplace, creating a better customer experience.",1
"Aside from Google and Yelp, consumers do not have many options for discovering local businesses.",0
Groupon is adjusting its approach to both the end consumer and to businesses in order to enhance the customer experience and improve the health of its marketplace platform.,1
"However, the new effort to improve the user experience and make bold bets on new products is a sign that the company is taking the challenge seriously.",1
The biggest is targeting multi-unit franchise owners.,1
The company said that it hopes to lure these operators into the system through potential acquisitions of existing restaurant portfolios.,1
"It believes that a new design, flexible footprint, brand awareness and low startup costs can help lure these operators into the system.",1
"“Historically, Subway has been a system of primarily single-restaurant operators,” Steve Rafferty, SVP of development for the Milford, Conn.-based company, said in a statement.",1
"Subway has traditionally targeted lower-cost, inline locations for development.",1
Subway also says it is focusing on international growth.,1
"The company says it has signed eight master franchise deals and development agreements that could add 5,000 locations around the world in years to come.",1
"But it’s the focus on multi-unit franchisees that remains the more notable effort for the brand, whose average operator owns just two locations—most of which are low-volume restaurants.",1
"The typical Subway averages about $430,000 in revenues per year, according to data from Restaurant Business sister company Technomic.",0
"Since the brand peaked at about 27,000 domestic locations in 2014, about 6,000 locations have closed down, most of those in the past three years—including 1,000 last year.",1
"Subway believes larger-scale franchisees could have more wherewithal, which could enable them to fund remodel projects or expansion.",1
One problem for the brand is its low unit volumes.,0
"The company says that 75% of the system, featuring more than 15,000 locations, were up an average of 8.2% over 2019 levels in the first three months of 2022.",0
How does going digital change a legacy retail brand?,1
"According to Barbara Martin Coppola, CDO at IKEA Retail, it’s a challenge of remaining fundamentally the same company while doing almost everything differently.",1
What does it mean for one of the world’s most recognizable retail brands to go digital?,1
"For almost 80 years, IKEA has been in the very analogue business of selling its distinct brand of home goods to people.",0
"Three years ago, IKEA Retail (Ingka Group) hired Barbara Martin Coppola — a veteran of Google, Samsung, and Texas Instruments — to guide the company through a digital transformation and help it enter the next era of its history.",1
How is the digital transformation at IKEA changing how the company actually operates in the day-to-day?,1
We have transformed our stores to also act as fulfilment centers.,1
"Ecommerce is open 24 hours a day, while traditional stores are not, which means we’ve needed to learn how to operate at two speeds, while operating from one space.",1
We’re rapidly expanding data and analytics and changing how they’re embedded in decision making.,1
"With the pandemic and with the closure of approximately 75% of our stores, we ramped-up and accelerated even more as people turned online and towards digital solutions.",1
"We are transforming our business: We are exploring potential new offers to customers, new ways to bring our offers to customers, and new ways to operate our business.",1
"And in order to be successful, digital needs to be embedded in every aspect of IKEA.",1
"Now, this process is a bit like an iceberg.",0
"At the top of the iceberg, we have the customer needs and adaptation — revamping everything around customer interaction and new purchasing journeys — and under the surface we are making huge changes to our business and operating model.",1
"We are revamping customer interactions both digitally and, in the store, and we’re connecting them.",1
It also requires a different way of operating to fulfill the goods to be bought.,1
"It requires reengineering of the full value chain, which needs to be governed by data and become more flexible than before.",1
"The result is meant to be a seamless, consistent customer experience.",0
"These transformations are happening at many layers within the company, and they require a multi-year strategy and a clear North Star to follow.",1
How has your strategy changed as you moved through this process?,1
The scope of the strategy has increased significantly over time as the company realized that digital needs to be embedded into everything we do.,1
"Our first focus was on revamping all meetings with the customer, especially online with new and improved navigation and search function.",1
"For example, stores became fulfillment centers.",1
"Can you elaborate a bit on how to make sure the vision for the company remains consistent, even as you’re enacting fundamental changes?",1
"We are reinventing IKEA for the future, no less than that.",1
"At the beginning, this meant we needed to ensure that the transformation kept the IKEA DNA intact — that is, the culture, the values and the vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people.",0
"How to embed ethical behavior, respect diversity, how to treat people fairly — without bias — through technology.",0
"This means that we are focusing more on what we should do with data, rather than what we could do with data.",1
This means we have built a lot of trust.,0
"So, we’re taking a new approach.",1
"Our first step to tackle this was the Customer Data Promise, our commitment to putting people first in all data-driven processes.",1
"We want to provide customers with understanding, control, and the ability to make decisions about their data, so we added a functionality that lets consumers edit their data in the app at any given time.",1
"They see a centralized data control panel in the app, where they can change and personalize their inspirational feed and get contextual access to their data settings.",0
How does your experience at a place like Google shape how you think about a task like this digital transformation at IKEA?,1
"This is what attracted me to IKEA, people here always come first, and they are the number one priority for the business.",0
"At Google, I was going to work with the deep belief that I was making people’s lives better — at that time we were revolutionizing how technology could help people.",0
This has helped us a lot when going through our transformation.,1
"We know there will be challenging times, but we also know there is something bigger than our own reality, it helps us put energy and heart into creating an IKEA for generations to come.",0
How much of being a successful CDO is addressing cultural and human issues?,0
IKEA originates from the south of Sweden.,0
I had to show through my behavior that I share the same values.,0
"And it’s important to bring your whole self to work, including the vulnerable side, especially during the pandemic.",0
"Giving people the permission to be human doesn’t make you less effective, in fact I see it as an important step to building trust.",0
How do AR and VR feature in your plans for IKEA’s future?,1
"We’ve been testing VR in the store, to visualize how a piece of furniture fits in a room.",0
We recently acquired a California company by the name of Geomagical Labs.,1
"It’s a tool for democratizing home design, and that means it must be accessible to everyone.",0
"But what has your experience been, and what have you learned from it?",0
"The resilience we have built so far is why we are where we are now, in a position of strength, always looking to grow and improve.",0
Sony revealed a new business strategy that is ambitiously targeting an operating profit of at least $4.3 billion in the company's 2017 fiscal year (ending March 31st 2018).,1
Sony said it will use a goal of 10% return on equity (ROE) as the main indicator by which it will measure its profit target.,1
"Primarily, Sony has said it will no longer look to pursue growth in business areas where intense competition puts it at a disadvantage.",1
"Although Sony will still make smartphones and TVs, it will not ""rule out considering an exit strategy"" in these areas.",1
A possible spinoff or partnership for these divisions seems likely.,1
"The strategy will therefore see Sony shift to more profitable business areas, such as camera sensors, videogames and entertainment products.",1
"This covers Devices, Game & Network Services, Pictures, and Music.",0
"Sony will employ aggressive capital investment in these areas, with the aim of achieving sales growth and profit expansion.",1
"There will be increased investment in image sensors, as well as enhanced R&D in the area, expanding their applications in everything from smartphones to medical treatment.",1
"Meanwhile, Sony will work to expand the installed user base of the PlayStation platform.",1
"In Pictures, Sony will focus on increasing its audience, and for Music it will centre growth on burgeoning areas such as the streaming music market.",1
"Here, Sony will prioritise the generation of steady profit and positive cash flow for Imaging Products & Solutions, and Video & Sound.",1
"By capitalising on its existing technological expertise in these areas (rather than engaging in large-scale investment), and by optimising fixed costs and enhancing inventory control, Sony will target a profit maximisation and return on investment.",1
"By carefully selecting the territories and product areas it targets, Sony will seek to limit its capital investment and establish a business structure capable of securing stable profits.",1
"To achieve stability, the company is aiming to spin off its Video and Sound business unit in October 2015, establishing it as a wholly-owned subsidiary.",1
Sony says it will also explore potential alliances with other companies.,1
"Indeed, even now it is still restructuring, selling off its PC division and spinning off its TV business, as well as cutting thousands of jobs.",1
"However, many in the technology industry have praised Sony's trajectory over the past year, which has seen its share value increase by over 80%.",1
"This growth has been partly attributed both to the recent appointment of Kazuo Hirai to company CEO, and to the appointment of Kenichiro Yoshida as his Chief Strategy Officer in late 2013.",1
"As this announcement suggests, the pair are likely to continue to aggressively pursue restructuring over the short to medium term.",1
"During Mr Hirai's recent strategy presentation, he placed particular emphasis on profitability over volume, securing business unit autonomy with a focus on shareholder value and providing a clearer definition of each business unit's position within Sony's overall business.",1
"The fourth-largest toymaker in the world at the time (today it is fifth-largest), the Lego Group sold €1 billion (US$1.35 billion) worth of toys in 2004, ranging from its snap-together bricks for young children to Mindstorms, a line of do-it-yourself robot kits for older kids.",1
"Even in the digital age, its toys maintained a surprisingly firm grip on the market and seemed to adapt well to changing tastes.",0
"Lego Group executives estimated that the company was destroying €250,000 ($337,000) in value every day.",0
Some observers speculated that the Lego Group had overdiversified its product line with moves into such areas as apparel and theme parks.,1
"The company leadership knew it had to address those problems, and that the supply chain posed the most immediate opportunity for improvement.",1
And it would address head-on one of the company’s most pressing challenges.,1
"Having established itself in an era when supply chain management was a matter of moving boxes from here to there, the Lego Group had missed a sea change as retail giants like Wal-Mart and Carrefour gained dominance.",1
The company’s supply chain was geared for custom delivery to the smaller retailers that had owned the toy market in the 1950s when its bricks first became popular.,1
"In the 1990s, as competitors focused on regearing for the big-box stores, the Lego Group considered its primary challenge to be brand building — despite the fact that its bricks were already among the most recognized toys in the world.",1
(U.S. operations were a notable exception to this problem.),0
"To rebuild profitability, the company had to refashion every aspect of its supply chain.",1
"That meant eliminating inefficiencies, aligning its innovation capacity with the market, and re-gearing to compete in the new big-box world.",1
"The company’s leadership team recognized that even though transformation would be painful, it was imperative.",1
What made those problems especially hard to identify was that they grew out of the company’s core strengths: its capacity for innovation and its commitment to quality.,0
"Those were the very advantages that the company’s leaders had relied on at first to reverse the profitless streak, hoping the company could innovate its way out of trouble.",1
"From the mid-1990s through 2004, the Lego Group moved into video games, TV programs, and retail stores.",1
"But the diversification added layers of complexity, and the red ink continued to flow.",1
"In 2004, the family that had founded and run the Lego Group knew they had to change direction.",1
"The then CEO Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the carpenter who had launched the company in 1932 and created the first snap-together Lego bricks in 1949, convened the leadership team to chart a new course.",1
"The measures they considered were radical, and to execute them, the Kristiansen family turned to an outsider.",1
"Kristiansen had been CEO for 25 years when he stepped aside in October 2004 for Knudstorp, then 34, a onetime management consultant who had joined the company in 2001 as a director of strategic development.",1
"With the mandate for change clear, Knudstorp spent his first weeks as CEO working closely with Kristiansen and the other members of the board and the leadership team to pinpoint the source of the company’s problems.",1
Was the Lego Group too diversified?,1
"That hypothesis withered in the face of a simple fact: Three-quarters of the Lego Group’s sales every year were from new, mostly nonelectronic products.",1
"Instead, as Knudstorp and his team examined every facet of the company’s operations, they came to focus on the supply chain.",1
"They approached it holistically, analyzing every aspect of the company’s product development, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution.",1
Product Development.,0
But the leadership team found that new products were delivering less and less profit.,1
"A far cry from the simple box of bricks that baby boomers grew up with, Lego sets had grown much more elaborate: A pirate kit included eight pirates with 10 types of legs in different attire and positions.",0
"Furthermore, introducing new products every year is not necessarily a bad thing, but the Lego Group did not align its supply chain with that business strategy.",1
"Just 30 products generated 80 percent of sales, while two-thirds of the company’s 1,500-plus stock keeping units (SKUs) were items that it no longer manufactured.",1
"And the number of SKUs multiplied every year, increasing that backlog.",0
These sourcing practices led to incredible waste.,0
Ordering so many specialized products at irregular intervals from a large number of vendors left the Lego Group’s procurement staff powerless to leverage the company’s scale in dealing with suppliers.,1
Manufacturing.,0
Day-to-day operations were often chaotic.,0
The Lego Group paid as much attention to the thousands of stores that together generated only one-third of its revenue as it did the 200 larger chains that accounted for the other two-thirds.,1
"Without clearly defined service policies, the company spent a disproportionate amount of time and effort serving small shops, which drove up the costs of fulfillment substantially.",1
Sixty-seven percent of all orders consisted of less than a full carton — an incredibly costly proposition that demands labor-intensive “pick-packing” at the distribution center.,1
"In addition, to serve its many small customers, the Lego Group had developed a multiple-tier inventory system with local centers; it was very difficult to position the right product in the right distribution center, a challenge that contributed to missed sales and high inventory levels.",1
"The leadership team developed the strategy, while the larger group of planners and representatives from sales, logistics, IT, and manufacturing coordinated change at the operational level.",1
“This is still here?” he would ask.,0
Each team worked out its cross-functional plans through lengthy workshops.,1
"The process started with an examination of one aspect of the company’s supply chain complexity and an analysis of its impact on productivity, planning, and control.",0
"The executives understood that, for the initiatives to stand any chance of success, the Lego Group needed to preserve the loyalty of its workforce, even as the move to a more global supply chain did away with many jobs.",1
"The most respectful way to navigate through this transition, they reasoned, was to adopt a strategy of complete transparency.",1
(The Lego Group has also moved its U.S. plants to Mexico in search of labor cost savings and market proximity.),1
"In tandem with the planning and consultative processes, the leadership ordered a pilot program designed to make sourcing more strategic.",1
At its helm they placed Chief Financial Officer Jesper Ovesen — a clear signal that this initiative was of the utmost importance.,1
Ovesen’s team believed that rationalizing the cost of the company’s materials would be one of the easier parts of the transformation and would yield savings immediately.,1
"The price of colored resins, always a major expenditure for the company, was highly volatile.",0
The sourcing team analyzed the prices of the raw materials and worked with a narrowed roster of suppliers to stabilize pricing.,1
"More importantly, the success of the sourcing project created a sense of optimism and the momentum to move ahead with other changes.",1
"At each cost center along the supply chain, the transition team applied its new insight: Constraints don’t destroy creativity or product excellence, and they can even enhance them.",1
"Indeed, the idea of implementing new constraints could now help the company build on its established strengths.",1
"In the early years, this idea had helped the com­pany develop its brand and instill pride in its employees.",0
"They also recommended cutting back on the thousands of different police officers, pirates, and other figures in production.",1
"The team took a deliberate approach, building on the resin-sourcing work to analyze the true costs of each element and identify those whose costs were out of line with the rest of the stock.",1
"This initiative, coupled with the resin pilot, helped the Lego Group cut its resin costs in half and shrink its supplier roster by 80 percent.",1
"At the same time, the operational team put a process in place to help designers make more cost-effective choices.",1
"The initiative encouraged the designers to think in terms of price trade-offs when they were developing a new item: Yes, you can give sparkling amber eyes to your new Bionicle space alien action figure, but it may limit your choices on its claws.",1
“The best cooks are not the ones who have all the ingredients in front of them.,0
The designers seemed to take those words to heart.,0
"“I think one of the big mistakes companies often make in this kind of initiative is approaching the supply chain as one topic, innovation as another, product quality as a third.",1
"The team started by halting the time-honored practice of making every machine available to produce any element, an approach that necessitated constant, costly retooling.",1
"Instead, the team assigned specific molds to specific machines, and set up regular four- to 12-week production cycles.",1
"The group then deemed that sales and operations would set orders at a regular monthly meeting, reducing the need for constant changeovers.",1
"The Lego Group had already outsourced 10 percent of its production to Chinese contract manufacturers, but the team decided against sending more work to Asia.",1
"Instead, building on its successful experience moving some production to Kladno, Czech Republic, the company concluded that it could actually boost efficiency by locating its factories near its most important markets.",1
"In 2005, the Lego Group began outsourcing the manufacture of its simpler products to a Hungarian facility belonging to Flextronics, a Singapore-based electronics manufacturer.",1
That year the company also expanded its operations in Kladno.,1
"Arriving at this point, however, was difficult in two ways: The negotiations were long and difficult, and the impact on the company’s workforce had to be managed with great care.",1
"Chief Purchasing Officer Niels Duedahl was tasked with overseeing the process, supported by a team of analysts who built detailed cost models.",0
Their philosophy was to understand their suppliers’ costs better than the suppliers themselves did.,1
This approach would enable the Lego Group’s leaders not just to evaluate the options but also to approach subcontractor proposals armed for negotiation.,1
The Lego Group also needed to move its distribution channels closer to the customer — and to lower its bloated distribution costs.,1
"First, the number of its logistics providers was cut from 26 to three or four — enough to ensure resilience and gain greater economies of scale while still encouraging competition among the suppliers.",1
But consolidating logistics providers really just brought the Lego Group in line with what many of its competitors had done years ago.,1
"However, the company was able to leapfrog the competition by redesigning its entire distribution system.",1
"Although many companies have taken manufacturing to lower-cost markets and to contract providers, surprisingly few have done the same with distribution, although identical advantages exist.",1
"The Lego Group phased out five centers in Denmark, Germany, and France and created a single new center in the Czech Republic, to be operated by DHL.",1
"“Putting all your eggs in one basket” might sound like a poor strategy to reduce risk, but consolidated distribution made inventory easier to track and made stock shortages far less likely.",1
"It also brought the Lego Group closer to Europe’s largest population centers, decreasing the average distance to market.",1
"With a new value chain in place, the Lego Group could act with the understanding that customers had differentiated needs.",1
"The company’s marketing team followed the examples of other consumer packaged-goods manufacturers, working more closely with the largest retailers to conduct joint forecasting, inventory management, and product customization.",1
Those big-box and chain stores that made up the bulk of the Lego Group’s market would receive marketing support as well.,1
"The company would continue to deal with smaller sellers, but on more regular and standardized terms.",1
The company further minimized the cost of serving each account by providing discounts for early orders and refusing to ship less-than-full cartons.,1
"Not only would this presumably make the big clients happier, but the retailers’ strong forecasting and replenishment technol­ogy would give the company marketers access to a greater level of insight into buyer behavior than the company had on its own.",1
"The Lego Group would also let these large retailers help make assortment decisions, and sweeten the relationship further by providing some SKUs on an exclusive basis.",1
"It has saved approximately €50 million ($67 million) since 2004, and forecasts savings in excess of €100 million ($135 million) over the next two years.",0
"The tremendous gains in efficiency meant that despite the impact of rising oil prices on materials and transportation, stock turnover increased by 12 percent in 2005, and the same year, the Lego Group recorded its first profits — €61 million ($72 million) — since 2002.",1
Getting the right product to the right place at the right time at the right cost was an important early step in grappling with an array of strategic challenges.,1
"“It has allowed us to again focus on developing the business, on innovation, and on developing our organization to become a much more creative place to work,” says Knudstorp.",1
"“Those are luxuries we didn’t have when we didn’t make money and we had a supply chain that was 10 to 15 years behind the times.” Now that the Lego Group has rationalized and streamlined its product development, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, it can pour its resources into what it does best: making wonderful toys.",1
"His work focuses on operations strategy, restructuring, and supply chain management.",1
He leads the firm’s European operations and specializes in procurement and supply chain management.,0
"DEERFIELD, ILL. — It was only six years ago when Kraft Foods spun off Mondelez International to create one of the largest snack-centric companies in the world.",1
"Since that time, management’s focus has been on growing the company’s “power brands,” those within the company’s portfolio that represent approximately three-quarters of net revenues, and margin management.",1
"Under new chairman and chief executive officer Dirk Van de Put, that’s about to change.",1
"He emphasized that while the company’s large brands and an efficient infrastructure remain important to the company, he said Mondelez must adapt to a changing marketplace.",1
"“We have a wide range of brands,” Mr. Van de Put said.",0
“Fine-tuning the role these brands play in our portfolio offers major opportunity.,1
The database allows the company to evaluate how consumers snack across different emotional or functional needs and occasions.,0
"“All this allows us to sharpen our brand positioning, improve our communication, ensure our portfolio remains incremental and avoid overlap, and it also identifies innovation and renovation opportunities.",1
"Mr. Van de Put said those brands remain important to the company’s future, but he has made a priority of unlocking some of Mondelez’s lesser-known local brands.",1
"“It is the leader in the biscuit market, with a strong heritage, a very emotional connection with local consumers and a very broad portfolio,” he said.",0
"“We recently reinvested in the brand, differentiated it more from competition, and we improved its in-store visibility.",1
"As a result, Opavia went from mid-single-digit declines to low single-digit growth.",1
The company’s “local” focus also will include the empowerment of sales and marketing teams on the ground in specific markets.,1
"“This means we have a tremendous opportunity to use our local strength in one category to boost our growth in the others,” he said.",1
"“We are also changing our innovation approach, switching to fast test and learn and then scale fast versus an immediate big launch,” he said.",1
“This will lead to more projects coming to market faster.,1
“The newer area of operational improvement is digitalization.,0
"It includes, of course, optimization of our supply chain operations, achieving omni-channel excellence or delivering consumer-centric digital marketing.",1
"Mr. Van de Put said the strategic changes the company is making will accelerate future sales growth to 3%-plus per year, and it will enable high single-digit earnings per share growth.",1
"“This is clearly a shift in our value-creation model,” he said.",1
"“For the past five years, our cost focus has lifted the company to the next level.",1
"We can now build on this and drive a more sustainable, higher-quality earnings growth approach.”",1
The earnings report comes as the company prepares to implement a new strategy that cuts its number of business divisions.,1
"The company announced management changes ahead of the October 1 start of its Vision 2020+ plan, which replaces the company’s Vision 2020 outline adopted in 2014.",1
"Under the new plan, whose beginning coincides with the start of the company’s next fiscal year and is scheduled to be in place by the end of March 2019, Siemens’ five industrial divisions will be combined into three operating companies.",1
"The company said the three operating entities—Gas and Power, Smart Infrastructure, and Digital Industries—will give its individual businesses “more entrepreneurial freedom.” The new units will work with what Siemens calls its Strategic Companies, which include Siemens Gamesa, Siemens Healthineers, and the planned Siemens Alstom train unit.",1
Management changes also are in the offing.,0
"Roland Busch, the company’s chief technology officer, will take the role of chief operating officer, with analysts saying the move could mean Busch would replace Joe Kaeser as chief executive officer if Kaeser steps down as planned in 2021.",1
"Lisa Davis, who has been leading the underperforming power and gas division, has been tapped to lead the new Gas and Power unit.",1
Siemens said it sold only five large gas turbines in the quarter and warned of further market declines.,1
Reports in June of this year said Siemens might consider selling its turbine unit.,1
"Kaeser in a statement about the new business strategy said, “It would be irresponsible to rest on our laurels now.",1
"The company in November 2017 said it would cut 6,900 jobs as it consolidates its power divisions.",1
"The company on August 1 said it is buying Mendix, a Boston, Massachusetts-based industrial software company, for $700 million.",1
"Siemens said it expects paring its number of business units will increase the company’s annual growth rate and profit margin for its industrial business by 2% over what it called the “medium term,” or the next three to five years.",1
Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek outlined three “strategic pillars” for the company going forward in a memo to staff Monday.,1
Chapek’s memo comes as Disney prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2023.,1
"“To that end — and in addition to all my other creative meetings — I am establishing a new standing monthly meeting with our senior creative leaders to discuss the opportunities we face as a storytelling enterprise,” Chapek wrote.",0
"“We must evolve with our audience, not work against them.",1
"Chapek added that “our long-term goal is to provide greater flexibility,” suggesting that the company could adjust its in-office plans in the future.",1
"Over the last two years, we continued to tell the world’s best stories, reorganized, and accelerated our transformation to better serve audiences and guests.",1
"And of course, we underwent a leadership change—and I am enormously grateful for the tremendous foundation Bob Iger left us.",0
It’s ironic that this disruption is happening as we prepare to celebrate our company’s 100th anniversary.,1
"For nearly a century, we have defined and redefined entertainment, created countless lifelong memories, and delighted fans and families around the world.",0
"And so I believe our mission for this year is clear: set the stage for our second century, and ensure Disney’s next 100 years are as successful as our first.",1
"First, storytelling excellence.",0
"They inspire, give hope, bring us together, illuminate the world around us, and create memories.",0
To that end—and in addition to all my other creative meetings—I am establishing a new standing monthly meeting with our senior creative leaders to discuss the opportunities we face as a storytelling enterprise.,0
"That must continue as technology evolves, giving our creative teams new canvases like the metaverse on which to paint.",0
"And third, relentless focus on our audience.",1
"But at the end of the day, our most important guide—our North Star—is the consumer.",0
"We must evolve with our audience, not work against them.",1
We have the world’s most creative storytelling engine along with the world’s most beloved brands and franchises—which we can bring to life in ways no one else can.,0
We bring people together and make magical memories that last a lifetime at our parks and on our cruise ships.,0
"I couldn’t think of a better combination, and I could not be more optimistic about our future.",0
"Danaher had built itself into a remarkably successful business over four decades by acquiring and integrating new companies into a unified whole, improving them through a group of distinctive management practices known as the Danaher Business System (DBS), then holding onto them.",0
"Although it’s sometimes compared to a private equity firm, Danaher is different — it buys and builds companies for the long term, not for rapid fix-up and sale.",1
"But from a strategic point of view, the split makes sense.",1
"One new company, which will retain the Danaher name, will focus on science and technology businesses.",1
"The other company, Fortive Corporation, will be made up of what Danaher calls its “industrial growth” enterprises.",1
"These are industrial end-market businesses with slightly more cyclical markets, high operating margins, and strong cash flow.",0
"The split is intended to provide each company with its own focus and to increase capital deployment flexibility, thus providing more opportunities for growth in each company’s distinctive way.",1
"Over the years, the company had evolved from a highly leveraged startup to a profitable family of ventures with a market capitalization of more than US$40 billion in 2013.",1
They and the other company leaders had developed a unique approach they called the Danaher Business System.,1
"Since 1980, its annualized returns to shareholders have been three times as high as those of the Standard & Poor’s Industrials Index.",0
"A split into two enterprises, Danaher and Fortive, is planned for the second half of 2016.",1
"Value proposition: As a “company that builds companies,” this consolidator adds value through M&A and operational excellence.",1
Danaher succeeds by acquiring and integrating companies that will thrive within its culture and with its capabilities system.,1
"Leadership development: Through this capability, the company engages people in learning sophisticated management practices.",0
"(the Danaher Business System): This capability drives operational improvement of quality, service, reliability, and cost, generating above-market growth and profitability.",0
Danaher’s innovation capability enables product development that meets the evolving needs of its diverse customer base.,0
"They bought some poorly run manufacturing companies, and discovered they could rebuild them and run them profitably.",1
"George Koenigsaecker: The Danaher Business System was born in 1986, when I was the president of the Jacobs Manufacturing Company in Bloomfield, Conn. “Jake Brake” was a formerly family-owned business that made brakes for diesel trucks.",1
"In 1984, the company had merged with Chicago Pneumatic, a maker of power tools and industrial equipment, which Danaher subsequently bought.",1
"In early 1988, I learned that Yoshiki Iwata and Chihiro Nakao, two Toyota Production System sensei who had been handpicked disciples of its chief architect, Taiichi Ohno, were teaching at the University of Hartford.",0
"So when I arrived at 11 p.m. with two Japanese guys, it got the attention of everyone on the night shift.",0
Where is your factory?” We were obviously buried in work-in-process.,0
That would get us a 3 percent productivity gain.,0
Danaher bought Chicago Pneumatic in a hostile takeover around the same time.,1
We thought they would kill our new approach.,1
"If they’d been conventional manufacturing guys, it wouldn’t have made sense to them.",1
Jim Lico: That Jake Brake plant is still a Danaher subsidiary.,0
It’s passed down from one generation of leaders to the next; it helps us learn why we are who we are.,0
"Steve Simms: As we grew the company through acquisitions, we rolled out the Danaher Business System to each new piece.",1
We set up kaizen [continuous improvement] sessions and policy deployment [PD] reviews for every business.,1
"You go to people down in payables for a day sales outstanding [DSO] number, and they say they don’t have it.",0
"Comas: In 1989, the Rales brothers hired George Sherman to become CEO.",1
Simms: The culture evolved from the top.,0
With George Sherman there was no confusion; DBS was the only way to run the business.,1
He’d write about that day’s kaizens.,0
Senior managers were actually rated every year on their proficiency with the DBS tools.,0
"We tie together culture, capability building, and people development this way.",0
It would signal a high level of importance when I spent a week facilitating a team that wasn’t even in my group.,0
Or a cell diagram presented by someone who can’t walk you through it when you ask them to.,0
"If you’re touting pabulum, that’s an unsafe place to be.",0
"That has helped Danaher focus on long-term growth, long-term margin expansion, and maintaining a great cash flow record over many years.",1
This group gets together several times a year.,0
"When we develop a new approach — for example, a lead-generation tool for Web marketing — there’s not some committee that does it; we all become students.",1
"Simms: In the early 2000s, [then CEO] Larry Culp asked if I’d be willing to lead a team to identify opportunities for organic growth, beyond what we already had.",1
We looked at different ways of thinking about product development and innovation inside and outside the company.,0
"We talked about advanced skills in sales, and pricing as a strategic weapon.",1
"It’s a radically different company, but its concepts on innovation stretched our thought process and led us to do a number of things differently.",1
We talked to experts on pricing and pricing analysis.,0
We customized what we learned to fit the Danaher culture.,1
"“If we’re going to be successful in organic growth, which tools are going to get us there?",1
We were driving ourselves crazy with all these metrics and data.,0
We had to do this if we wanted to scale up.,1
"Joyce: The first four core value drivers are core growth, operating margin expansion, working capital returns, and return on invested capital.",0
The next two are customer-facing metrics.,0
External quality is a broad measure of every dimension of a customer experience.,0
The internal fill rate is the percentage of managerial positions we fill with internal candidates.,0
Every Danaher business uses those eight metrics to answer the question: Are we winning?,0
"If an operating review shows green on all 20 monthly objectives, we know we probably have an issue.",0
"You want them to rise to the challenge, adopt stretch objectives, and seek to improve.",1
We try to remember this is about winning in the eyes of our customer.,0
"You can walk up to a visual board on the shop floor in any Danaher business, and the metrics have the same labels: safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory.",0
People want to win because winning is fun.,0
It started when we decided we would not wait for Goldman Sachs to call us with their prospects.,1
"Instead, we did our own up-front research into prospective markets and started to build funnels of names of companies to buy and industries to enter.",1
"Instead, we continue to explore many acquisitions and bring a significant number to fruition.",1
"Our main criterion: Through this acquisition, can we ultimately become one of the market leaders in that industry?",1
"That typically requires that we pick up one of the stronger brands or assets within that industry, and that we generate at least as much value as, if not more value than, the current owners do.",1
"Bill King: Often, when you do one deal, everybody thinks you’re not going to do another, so competitors come in thinking they have an advantage.",1
"On the contrary, we look for complementary companies to buy before we make an offer.",1
"When we bought Beckman Coulter in 2011, we were already aware that we wanted to buy Blue Ocean Biomedical, a cytometry firm that could reinvigorate Beckman’s hematology business.",1
We snatched it up within six months of closing on Beckman.,1
We look for large global markets with good growth profiles and generally low cyclicality.,0
"If we don’t like the market, we don’t bother looking at specific companies.",1
Their products have more pricing power.,1
They are also often poorly managed from a cost perspective.,0
"They’re making money from their technology and brand, but manufacturing, supply chain, and the back office are afterthoughts.",1
We do extensive due diligence on each one.,0
"Joyce: Larry Culp, my predecessor as CEO, could tell you stories about how long he cultivated Kathryn and Clifford Hach before acquiring the company they founded, the Hach Company, in 1999.",1
"It would make you wonder why we didn’t give up a lot sooner, but the model has proved successful.",1
You’d have to go back to our earliest days to find a hostile takeover.,0
"Comas: We might say to a company leader, “You don’t know us, but we’re interested in this space, and one day, if you think of selling your business, please talk to us.",1
"During due diligence, we assess their potential with the same metrics we use in our daily business.",0
"We publicly announce the return metric we want to see within a stated time period, and how we think we’re going to get there.",1
But it’s worked the other way.,1
"They understand that once the bidding on a deal gets up to a level where we no longer can hit our return, we move on.",1
We also assess whether management will buy into the Danaher Business System.,1
"Often we replace the CFO, because we’re very metric-oriented, and we want someone in place there who understands the Danaher metrics.",1
"Joyce: For each acquired company, we establish a target of having a strategic plan in place within 100 days of the closing of the transaction.",1
"Due diligence only goes so far, and we need the company management teams to play an integral role in defining a path for their future, in concert with us.",1
We were very aware of what it had taken to build the strength of that brand over 100 years.,0
We tried to preserve what was great about that business at the same time we brought in aspects of Danaher that added value.,1
Beckman is successful today because its leadership and the associates embraced DBS.,1
The dental businesses had great sales management practices that were new to us.,1
"When we acquired Fluke and Hach, we learned better product management.",1
"When we bought Tektronix and some of the life sciences businesses, we learned more about technology development, advanced R&D, and software development.",1
And those learnings were incorporated into all Danaher businesses.,1
"For example, there might be a sales leader or manufacturing executive who has grown up in a culture of delivering his commitments through brute force or other “heroics” at the end of the quarter.",0
"That approach may be successful in some companies, but not at Danaher.",1
That’s what creates competitive advantage.,1
"But when we acquire a new business, we can’t take the entire leadership team out of their jobs for weeks.",1
We send Danaher experts into that business for an eight-hour operating review every month.,0
"We organize our first weeklong kaizen around it, bringing together the senior team of the incoming business and some DBS leadership.",1
And they start to turn the corner.,1
Lico: We have the soul of a small company.,0
We are sometimes compared to private equity firms because we are so acquisitive.,0
"Sure, we want to monetize what we bought, just as much as private equity does, but we do it in a very different way.",1
We aren’t passionate about selling the business.,1
"LAFAYETTE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Waitr Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: WTRH) (“Waitr” or the “Company”) today announced it has changed its name to ASAP, signaling a new “deliver anything” business model.",1
The name change is the culmination of the Company’s recent transition to bring its best-in-class food delivery services to a broader array of products.,1
"ASAP’s new vision is delivering to consumers, same day, from any type of business.",1
"In preparation for the rebrand, the company accelerated the expansion of its services in recent weeks, signing agreements to launch delivery of a wide variety of items such as alcohol, sporting goods, luxury apparel, auto and electrical parts, and other need it now products.",1
"“ASAP expresses our new brand identity, building on our original delivery ethos,” said Carl Grimstad, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Waitr Holdings Inc. “The strategies we have implemented have reinforced our ‘anything, anywhere ASAP’ vision, making us the go-to company for a wider range of products and services.",1
"ASAP has secured exclusive in-stadium mobile ordering agreements with MetLife Stadium, the New York Giants, the New York Jets, the New Orleans Saints, the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University.",1
Still to be revealed this year will be the Company’s new stock ticker symbol aligning with the ASAP rebranding.,1
"Americans are eager to spend on clothes, toys and home decor.",0
"In its most recent quarter, Penney lost $101 million and was forced to offer steep discounts to clear a glut of clothing piling up in inventory.",1
Penney closed 141 stores last year is closing eight more this year.,1
The company’s downfall does not fit cleanly into the death-by-Amazon story of many retailers in recent years.,0
Its more flexible rivals have adjusted their businesses to remain relevant.,1
Kohl’s and Nordstrom have reinvented themselves with fresh brands and hipper stores.,1
"Analysts say the company lacks the cash and focused strategy to compete against big box sellers Target and Walmart, which are battling for every inch in stores, and Amazon, which is gobbling up digital sales.",1
"Penney is plagued by a “lack of understanding about what it is, what it stands for, and who it wants to serve,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.",1
"By the end of 2010, Penney’s sales had fallen 10% from their 2006 high of about $20 billion, and the company attracted the scrutiny of activist investor Bill Ackman.",1
"Ackman and real estate investment firm Vornado bought up a chunk of Penney, forced Ullman out and installed a new leadership team.",1
Penney is still plagued by the decision it made next — tapping Apple’s retail chief Ron Johnson as chief executive.,1
Penney ditched top private-label brands with loyal followings and introduced new ones that had little relevance to low- and middle-income customers.,1
"“Johnson walked away from the old audience and assumed that a new one would appear instantly from out of the blue,” Cohen explained.",1
"His biggest move — ending coupons and clearance sales — backfired, alienating Penney’s shoppers en masse.",1
Penney burned through cash under Johnson and got bogged down in an expensive and public legal fight with Macy’s over selling Martha Stewart’s kitchen line.,1
"With its stock in the dumps and its balance sheet damaged, Penney ousted Johnson in mid-2013, just 17 months after he took over.",1
"“A lot of trust between customers and JCPenney was destroyed during the Johnson era,” Saunders said.",0
"He slammed the brakes on Johnson’s strategy, and reinstated coupons and old brands.",1
Although Ullman stabilized sales and stopped the stock from declining further — it had dropped from more than $140 a share in 2011 to around $20 — Penney found it difficult to dig out from its mistakes.,1
"As rivals adopted digital strategies and invested to improve their store experiences, Penney’s financial distress gave it little room to spruce up stores, buy trendy merchandise, and hire more employees.",1
"“We are still trying to fully recover from the self-inflicted wounds of the previous strategy,” Ullman said in early 2015, before he stepped down as CEO.",1
"Although Penney is known best for selling clothes, it turned to Marvin Ellison, a former top executive at Home Depot, to lead it into the appliance business.",1
"Ellison believed the shift would position Penney to take advantage of Sears’ collapse, but customers shrugged.",1
"In May, Ellison abruptly left Penney to head up Lowe’s, spooking Wall Street.",1
Ellison also exited Penney with a fashion unit lacking direction and unsure of the type of brands it needed to offer to win over Millennials and moms.,1
"Penney, which had switched its focus from older shoppers to younger, trendier ones, is now moving back toward middle-aged women, with brands like Liz Claiborne.",1
"“We were no longer necessarily having the broad array of merchandise silhouettes that was most important for her,” he told analysts earlier this month.",1
"To escape its debt load, Penney would need to regain a chunk of the sales volume it has lost over the years, and do it at a profit.",1
It is searching for a CEO to replace Ellison and focusing on women’s clothing as it works to clear its inventory of brands that have gone out of fashion.,1
"Joseph Thomas, a Penney spokesperson, pointed to same-store sales growth last quarter as proof the brand still resonates with shoppers.",0
"The company has changed its merchandising strategy, too.",1
"It used to buy as much stuff it needed to fill up its stores, but now it’s chasing proven sales trends.",1
"Cohen, however, isn’t counting on a comeback.",1
"He argues Penney has failed to offer shoppers the right merchandise or a defined identity, and is carrying too much inventory after years of bad purchasing choices.",1
Things are changing at Starbucks.,1
"While strikingly optimistic in tone, the letter reveals that Starbucks will close up to 400 company-operated stores over the next 18 months.",1
But the really big announcement is the reason behind the closures.,1
"According to the letter, the company is laying the foundation for a ""transformational phase"" that will introduce a new store format known as ""Starbucks Pickup.""",1
"""Starbucks Pickup is tailored to customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the Starbucks mobile app for pick-up, or those who want their Starbucks delivered to them by placing an order through Uber Eats,"" the letter explains.",1
"""We believe this transformation of our store portfolio, blending Starbucks Pickup stores with traditional Starbucks stores in dense metropolitan markets, will elevate the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth.""",1
"What makes this idea so radical is the fact that Starbucks built much of its brand on being what former CEO Howard Schultz described as a unique ""third place,"" the place between work and home that customers could go to meet friends, get work done, or simply hang out.",1
"This is a major shift in strategy--a statement that the ""third place"" has become more symbolic than literal.",1
"For example, Starbucks says that even prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, it discovered that about 80 percent of transactions in U.S. company-operated stores were for ""on-the-go"" orders.",1
This insight led the company's leadership team to reexamine U.S. stores and devise a new strategy that could capitalize on changing customer behavior.,1
"In fact, according to the letter, this process of reevaluation and redesign of the store experience has already been underway for two years.",0
Let's break down what exactly Starbucks did.,1
"At the same time, company leadership had a realization about the brand.",1
"Yes, it had taken the company years to establish its reputation as that ""third place.""",1
Years of giving away free Wi-Fi.,0
"But with that emotional connection firmly in place (and the data to prove it), Starbucks leadership had the confidence needed to make adjustments that it hopes will allow the brand to become more efficient and improve customer experience.",1
"And now that the coronavirus has essentially changed the world, Starbucks is wasting no time executing its strategy--in fact, accelerating previous plans.",1
"We have here a great case study in how businesses can stay relevant, and take advantage of a negative situation to make positive changes.",1
But what if you didn't have any changes planned?,0
"Well, now's the time to take a long, hard look at your business, both pre- and post-pandemic.",1
"Get started, and make adjustments as needed.",1
We will evolve and add to this list as we work to achieve our vision of a more equitable and regenerative future for all.,0
"But David Kimbell, Ulta Beauty‘s chief executive, has a roadmap to build on his predecessor’s transformation, which has taken the chain from a mid-sized retailer to dominant national behemoth in just a few years.",1
"His lengthy list of to-dos includes an expansion into new functions, like ad sales, and new demographic markets as beauty consumers change how they shop.",1
"At the core of his plan, however, is diversity.",1
"As Mary Dillon’s right-hand man for eight years, Kimbell played a key role in Ulta’s transformation.",1
"He joined the beauty retailer as chief marketing officer and chief merchant in 2013 before becoming president in 2019, and then CEO last year.",1
"In contrast, its main rival Sephora, which is owned by LVMH, skews higher end and almost never operated in strip malls until its partnership with Kohl’s last year.",1
But the beauty business is rapidly changing and Ulta has to change with it.,1
"Retailers like Walgreens,Walmart and of course, Sephora, are making a bigger play for the market, delivering a faster cadence of new beauty brands at all price points.",1
"“I recognize that the playbook that we’ve used to get here is not going to drive us into the future,” Kimbell tells Fortune.",1
But it also requires an understanding that inclusivity is table stakes for a beauty brand.,1
"“We know historically, beauty has had unattainable standards.",0
But those standards have long reflected a bias in favor of white women.,0
"Ulta says it recently ramped up efforts to provide better offerings for customers of color, its fastest growing demographic.",1
"Last year, the company joined 27 other brands to sign the Fifteen Percent Pledge, a vow by top consumer companies to dedicate at least 15% of shelf space to Black-owned brands.",1
"The company has made some headway on this goal over the last year, doubling the number of Black-owned brands it carries to 28, and bringing the company just over the halfway mark.",1
"Earlier this month, it began selling Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty line, which has been praised for offering cosmetics in an extensive array of skin tones.",1
"At Ulta’s investor day last autumn, Kimbell’s first as CEO, the company said it would spend $8.5 million on advertising with Black or Latino-owned agencies, among other efforts.",1
"“I was in beauty and, frankly, not by choice,” he says.",0
But it did prep him for Ulta.,1
"He later spent seven years in PepsiCo’s food business through 2008, followed by two at Seventh Generation, a Unilever division focused on eco-friendly household items.",1
"But it was in 2011 that he landed the role that would put him on the CEO path, however circuitously: CMO at U.S. Cellular.",1
"When she left for Ulta’s corner office in 2013, he followed her.",1
"Now, it’s Kimbell’s turn to leave a stamp on the company and search for new revenue streams.",1
"Under his leadership, Ulta last autumn launched UB Media, which uses the mountain of customer data Ulta receives from its sales and loyalty programs to sell ad space on Ulta’s web site and on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.",1
The retailer is also pursuing partnerships.,1
"In 2021 year, it struck a deal with rival Target to open small Ulta shops in what will be 800 of the big-box retailer’s 1,950 stores, helping Ulta reach countless more customers.",1
The current beauty boom will likely continue for the foreseeable future.,0
"“The beauty category is dynamic, it’s innovative and it’s creative,” Kimbell says.",0
"The machines themselves are too noisy, or too likely to spread disease (bacteria live in air conditioning systems).",0
It is an obelisk-like device with a small wind tunnel that draws air through it from the room where it is positioned.,0
"The product is targeted directly at a consumer segment that no other company, in the West or the East, has recognized, and that could end up being much bigger than a niche.",1
"Even the decision to use the phrase “cool, not cold” in its Chinese advertising campaign reflects this principle.",1
"While the marketing staff digested the insights gained from Haier’s online customer interactions, manufacturing was already considering what they would mean for production, procurement was speaking directly to suppliers about sourcing feasibilities, and after-sales service was developing plans for follow-through.",1
"This allowed products to go to market as soon as they were designed and developed, instead of waiting for each department to throw its work “over the wall” to the next one.",1
"The company is known for several distinctive capabilities: a precise understanding of consumer needs, especially in China and other emerging markets; the ability to rapidly innovate new types of appliances that meet those consumer needs; the management of complicated distribution networks, a skill honed in the complex Chinese market; and a high level of execution ability, including the automation of factories to deliver products to consumer specification.",0
"These attributes have served it especially well in China, allowing Haier to outcompete more experienced appliance companies such as Whirlpool and Maytag in that country.",0
"In fact, Haier’s prowess — and particularly its emphasis on “what we can do and who we are” rather than on “what we sell and how we make money” — shows the kind of capabilities needed by companies that were founded in emerging economies if they are to succeed in the global sphere.",1
Value Proposition: Haier’s “way to play” in the market (its value proposition) has gradually broadened since Zhang Ruimin became CEO in the mid-1980s.,1
"The company first took the role of a category leader, maintaining top market share because of its reputation for quality in China.",1
Then it became a customizer (adapting its products to customer demands) and a solutions provider (helping consumers manage issues like water quality and home design).,1
"Haier now sells not just home appliances but related services, adapted to consumer demand in China, and, increasingly, other markets.",1
"Since 2011, it has held the largest worldwide market share in white goods.",0
"With its upscale brands in China, such as Casarte, and its growing presence in the United States, Europe, and Japan, this US$38 billion company has moved out of the value-priced and niche appliance domain to compete directly with top-of-the-line appliances from more established companies.",1
"Throughout the 30 years of his tenure, his sharp focus on customer service leadership has given the company consistency even as it propels Haier through dramatic changes.",1
"Zhang was the leader who proposed that Haier should never see itself as just a manufacturer of products, but instead as a provider of solutions to its customers’ problems.",1
"In the earliest years, that meant bringing new levels of quality and reliability to Chinese products.",1
"Later, it involved increasingly sophisticated forms of customization and new types of services.",1
This approach is especially noteworthy within China’s cultural and social context.,0
"Haier has thus invested a great deal, especially for a Chinese company, in training its employees and demanding innovative ideas.",1
"“The only thing that we know is that we know nothing,” he says.",0
"The first reinvention, in the 1980s, was the decision to differentiate the company by the quality of its products.",1
"The third, which took place in the 2000s, was the reorganization into a bottom-up structure, in which self-managing teams led decision making.",1
"The fourth, going on today, is the reinvention of Haier as a truly Internet-based company, open to the world in a way that few other companies have attempted, let alone realized.",1
Haier is reinventing itself as a truly Internet-based company.,1
Zhang did not develop this management approach on his own.,1
"Zhang often takes his own notes, and he frequently applies the concepts to Haier — first in small experiments, and then rolled out through the company.",1
"Looking to recoup, Western manufacturers cast covetous eyes on China’s emerging market.",1
"Most Chinese families lacked basic home appliances, and the offerings from local manufacturers did not meet basic standards for quality or consumer appeal.",0
"With their strong brands and relatively sophisticated technology (the automatic refrigerator icemaker and microwave oven had recently been introduced), overseas manufacturers believed that they would have an easy time in cities like Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai.",1
But Chinese domestic firms fiercely defended their home markets by drastically reducing prices.,1
General Electric chose not to enter the China market at all because it foresaw the price war.,1
"One of the Chinese companies that won this round was the Qingdao Home Appliance Company, a small collective enterprise that had made various electronic devices, including washing machines, but had recently settled on refrigerators.",1
"Nonetheless, the company was moribund.",0
"He found no acceptable candidates, and reluctantly took up the challenge himself.",1
"Zhang was a visionary who saw that a middle class would emerge in China, a public interested not just in refrigerators, but in high-quality, branded, innovative products — made in China, but as good as or better than their Western-made counterparts.",1
“We had just over 400 refrigerators in the warehouse.,0
Never again would the Qingdao Home Appliance Company sell products it could not be proud of.,1
"Instead, it would build appliances that solved problems for its customers — the first problem being the unreliability and poor quality of refrigerators in China.",1
"Soon after, in 1985, the company reestablished itself as a joint venture with the German manufacturing company Liebherr, thus gaining access to advanced technologies.",1
It changed its name to Qingdao-Liebherr to evoke the prestige and quality of German manufacturing.,1
"Haier, a simplified Chinese transliteration of the second part of the German Liebherr, was chosen in part because it was easy to remember and euphonic in both Chinese and English.",0
"Zhang also linked pay to performance in a manner previously unseen in the Chinese market, through a system called “Overall Every Control and Clear” (OEC).",1
"Every day, workers tracked quality results using paper and pencil, and their wages were tied directly to the outcomes.",0
"In the years that followed, as new business models were introduced, the disciplined mind-set of OEC was never abandoned.",1
"Instead, it was scaled up to meet ever more ambitious goals.",1
"The local distributor sent a technician to the farmer’s house, where he discovered that the farmer had been using the washing machine not to wash clothes but to clean sweet potatoes.",1
"Inspired, the company soon released a vegetable washing machine, designed to accommodate the extra grime and soil of the tubers.",1
"In response to this consumer need, Haier launched a small, low-energy washing machine called the Little Prodigy that could easily fit into a small, crowded urban apartment.",1
"The machine became extremely popular, among, for example, families with newborn children.",0
These episodes represented the start of the second reinvention at Haier: a new form of customer-responsive innovation.,1
"This was timely, because quality was no longer a great differentiator in China; other companies had caught up.",1
"Zhang built upon the company’s hard-won workforce discipline, and the accompanying performance–pay relationship, to link employees directly to customers.",1
"He avoided the conflicts of a matrix structure by introducing “market chains” (based on the value-chain concepts of Michael Porter), in which it was possible for all individuals at Haier, no matter what their role, to trace their actions directly to the marketplace.",1
These market chains replaced functional silos as the key organizational unit.,1
This was also the phase in which Zhang began building Haier into a global company.,1
"He approached this challenge by adopting Mao Zedong’s strategy of “occupying the rural areas to encircle the city,” gaining strength first with niche products for sectors where there were few competitors.",1
"In 1997, recognizing the needs of college students in dormitory rooms, it launched mini-refrigerators in the United States.",1
"And then, during the 2000s, Haier parlayed that success into becoming a mainstream producer of appliances for the U.S. market.",1
"Meanwhile, in Pakistan, Haier sold extra-large washing machines designed for heavy robes.",1
"For example, U.S.-based R&D engineers are required to talk directly to consumers in the design of new products, and their salary is linked to the sales results of the products they design.",0
"He believed that Haier suffered from unnecessary time delays and guesswork about new product manufacturing volumes, which proved costly when it guessed wrong, and that could be reduced, if not completely avoided, by becoming more intimately aware of customer needs and wants.",1
"Haier thus inverted its organizational structure into one based on self-organizing work units called ZZJYTs (an abbreviation for zi zhu jing ying ti, which translates to independent operating unit).",1
"Their three most critical functions — marketing, design, and manufacturing — were now supposed to work directly for customers.",1
"Instead of directing the employees who did that work, the ZZJYT managers became service providers to them, giving them the resources and guidance they needed to provide for customers.",1
"This minimized the decisions made at higher levels in the hierarchy, making the company more responsive to nascent market needs.",1
"Zhang went so far as to announce that this shift in organizational model would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of flagging, and even if it were necessary to use some of the returns from successful legacy offerings to make it work.",1
"The new structure proved successful, and the ZZJYTs are still the basic organizational unit at Haier.",1
"Everyone, whatever their function, is expected to talk to consumers regularly.",0
"To Zhang and others at Haier, this organization design represents an explicit effort to avoid being disrupted by technological change.",1
"Salespeople keep in close touch with customers, so they can estimate the order numbers with a smaller variance than if they were relying only upon forecasts.",1
"Once the products are ready for shipment, they go first to the waiting-list clients, and only afterward to retail outlets.",1
"This way, Haier keeps inventories low, which saves storage costs and working capital.",1
"When Haier made the strategic choice to launch a three-door refrigerator, for example, it invited its employees to compete for the role of leading this initiative by submitting business plans and business models explaining how such a product could best succeed.",1
"The company’s $1.5 billion three-door refrigerator business is now led by the winner of that competition, 38-year-old Pu Xiankai.",1
"He was selected, despite his relative youth, because he described the product in an imaginative way.",0
"Once appointed to this position, it was incumbent upon him to select a team and to find manufacturers and marketers within Haier to produce and sell his products.",1
The ZZJYT leaders also know that they cannot develop all the cutting-edge technologies they need in-house.,1
"Therefore, willingly embracing the concept of open innovation, they collaborate with organizations everywhere they operate — which is how the company ends up working with the best universities and research institutes in the world.",1
"To provide talent for the ZZJYTs, Haier created an internal labor market.",1
"Instead of offering its employees jobs, the company offers everyone a continuing series of opportunities to find jobs, considering the contributions they have already made.",1
"Its culture — embracing rather than resisting change, while holding true to its original core principle of customer service leadership — is the most important asset of the company today.",0
"This is known at Haier as the “networking strategy.” Even the ZZJYTs, the focal point of the previous wave’s business model, are slated for dramatic change.",1
"Zhang has proposed eliminating the current second-tier ZZJYTs, presently home to most of Haier’s middle managers.",1
"The company would instead become a collection of platforms, each able to adjust to changes in the consumer market by drawing on support and collaboration from the others.",1
"This new Haier approach involves opening up the company to intensive collaboration not just with customers, but with innovators around the world — including with competitors.",1
"In the past, our relationship with a supplier like Mitsubishi might have consisted of us going to them and giving them the specs for a new air conditioning compressor.",1
"The company entered the business through a joint venture with the Strauss Group, an Israeli technology firm, which provided the technology while Haier focused on marketing, distribution, and service.",1
"But then Haier broadened its platform to include many other R&D partners; for instance, it shares more than 20 water purification patents with Dow Chemical.",1
"For example, the company now uses Internet access to customize every product it sells in China, whether bought in a store or online.",1
"Customers choose the color combinations, features (such as the number and layout of shelves in the refrigerator), and ancillary design elements (like the pattern of sparkles on a high-end appliance).",0
"The process is not unlike choosing the accessories on a new car, except that there tend to be more choices.",0
The Internet connection also makes customers more likely to buy a water purifier — which is sold only by consultation.,1
"Haier reps are trained to look up the complex data on China’s water problems, which vary by neighborhood, and to install the filters that guard against that neighborhood’s mix of chemicals and pollutants.",1
"Building on its success to date, the company is now exploring partnerships with local communities to manage their water purification efforts community-wide.",1
The connection to customers has helped Haier migrate many people from their medium-value line of household appliances (the original Haier) to the more upscale Casarte brand.,1
The phrase “the information is more valuable than the product” has already become a slogan throughout Haier.,1
They give us a better understanding of users’ needs.,0
"The goal of a large company, he says, is to “lose control step by step.” In other words, Zhang believes that Haier isn’t unique.",1
"Every major organization will have to learn how to maintain its identity, the quality of its products and service, and its customer relationships, while being prepared to give up everything else.",1
Haier’s role in this new world will be as a pathfinder: It’s already the first leading global consumer manufacturing company from China.,1
"Soon, if Zhang is once again correct, it will be the first company from anywhere with its distinctive, innovative form of management.",1
"In 2018, the clean tech darling Nikola posted a video of its new electric truck driving down a remote stretch of road, framed by dramatic music and a setting sun.",0
"The Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of the country’s largest companies — from Comcast to Coca-Cola, Walmart to Wells Fargo — issued its Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation in the summer of 2019.",0
"In so doing, it joined a broad coalition — from U2’s Bono to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — who want capitalism to serve workers, customers, and the environment in addition to shareholders.",1
"As investors who helped launch Bain Capital’s social impact fund, we applaud the commitment to reorient business toward the greater good.",1
But we should approach the latest commitments to ESG with skepticism.,0
"According to research last year, investors who signed onto the United Nations principles did not improve the social and environmental performance of their investments.",0
"Most people struggle to differentiate bad-faith recycling claims from substantive actions to eliminate waste, like Unilever’s commitment to cut its plastic use in half or Philips’s to repurpose all of its used medical systems.",1
"Or to differentiate temporary payments for workers during the pandemic from permanent improvements, like Costco’s announcement it would raise baseline pay to $16 an hour, more than double the national minimum wage.",1
A movement meant to benefit the public good risks becoming a buzzword coopted to keep maximizing short-term profits.,0
This created a sense of accountability that social and environmental commitments desperately require today.,0
The wild west of ESG standards may soon be tamed.,0
"The latest commitments from business leaders to “do well by doing good” have centered on supporting workers, responding to racial injustice, and fighting climate change.",1
"We are beginning to see consumers take up the cause, as they now expect companies to take a stand on social and environmental issues.",0
And companies respond.,1
"Following the success of Burger King’s Impossible Whopper, which features a vegan patty with a tenth of beef’s carbon footprint, McDonald’s announced its own “McPlant” burger this past fall.",1
"In January, General Motors pledged to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",1
United Airlines has committed to reducing 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.,1
These are consumer companies that increasingly rely on matching the values of their customers to survive.,1
"This follows employee protests and walkouts in recent years against sexual harassment, migrant detention, and discrimination.",0
"Third, companies who are serious about becoming more sustainable, inclusive, and socially responsible should consider putting their purpose into their charter and becoming benefit corporations.",1
"This new breed of companies is explicitly balancing profit with a stated public benefit, such as improving its customers’ health, creating good jobs, or restoring ecosystems.",1
"There are more than 3,500 Certified B Corps, including consumer brands like Patagonia and Seventh Generation, along with many smaller companies funded by social impact investors.",0
Our economy is no more moved by an invisible hand than a Ouija board is moved by invisible spirits.,0
"Companies that don’t adapt will find themselves at odds with their customers, employees, investors, and regulators.",1
"Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch predicted that we will soon see legal action “that goes beyond regulatory scrutiny to environmental justice, to racial inequality and ESG more broadly.” She continued: “Certain industries that may have been seen as contributors to systemic inequality may want to look at their role in undoing that inequality.” Expectations have changed; companies’ stakeholders are demanding more than hollow marketing and happy talk.",1
It now has to prove to a skeptical public that early optimism in the company was justified.,1
"In the past, organizations often relied on one-off IT projects and applications to address business needs.",0
"In today’s rapidly changing environment, they are now turning to technological co-discovery and bold bets to operate and thrive.",1
"Organizations that understand this fundamental shift must learn to navigate such challenges as building capabilities, modernizing platforms, creating a software engineering culture, and leveraging data and analytics to improve operations and products.",1
"We help deliver end-to-end tech-enabled transformations for our clients by focusing on IT infrastructure, architecture, data, operations, and overall technology strategy.",1
"Southwest Airlines' business model is based on extremely efficient operations, low-cost pricing, and innovative logistics solutions.",1
"Furthermore, their strategy also includes a deep focus on customer experience and looking ahead.",1
"Through this sound strategy, Southwest achieved multiple competitive advantages that have allowed it to stay relevant in a rapidly changing world.",1
Key Takeaways Southwest Airlines is more flexible than most other large airlines.,1
Southwest is the only large U.S. airline that is also a low-cost carrier.,1
Southwest Airlines' strategy emphasizes recruiting and retaining motivated employees.,1
Southwest continues to improve its business model and practices.,1
"When business conditions decline, only the strong survive.",0
"That means Southwest has bigger reserves in cash, credit, and other assets than smaller airlines.",1
"Bigger doesn't always mean better, but it usually does mean safer when it comes to investing.",0
"They focus on providing the lowest prices for the most popular routes, which means fewer routes will need to be abandon.",1
"Negative economic growth will also make businesses and consumers more sensitive to ticket prices, the low-cost airlines' primary advantage.",1
Southwest is the only large airline that can compete on price.,1
Southwest prides itself on being a people-oriented airline that operates with friendly and approachable employees and team members.,0
Southwest Airlines has a business-oriented focus on the customer's experience.,1
One of these is Southwest's cancellation policy.,1
They allow a customer to cancel a reservation up to 10 minutes before the flight's departure.,1
Policies like this one ensure that the customers of Southwest Airlines remain satisfied.,0
These flexible policies help the airline to build high levels of brand loyalty.,1
The card allows them to accumulate Southwest Airlines points when making other purchases.,0
"Its pricing strategy offers extremely low prices compared to other large airlines, such as Delta and American Airlines.",1
Southwest had to build its business model around low operating costs to be able to offer low prices.,1
"It only has a few aircraft types, which helps the airline reduce its costs.",1
"If a customer can find a lower-priced ticket, Southwest Airlines matches the price.",1
It is boosted by a flexible business model that supports rapid change.,1
"Southwest is always looking for lower-cost solutions, and that is more important than ever before.",1
They're paying cash.,0
"General Motors and Ford are investing $65 billion between them – $35 billion at GM and $30 billion for Ford – and, so far, don't propose to borrow any of it.",1
"""The popularity of trucks [since the pandemic began] and strong pricing is giving them confidence.""",1
Detroit's aggressive investment and conservative financing has been years in the making.,1
"It has been aided by $4 billion borrowed by GM in May 2020, and by Ford drawing down a revolving credit line by $15 billion around the same time, moves intended to cushion a feared sales implosion from Covid-19.",1
"As sales declined more modestly than feared in 2020 and then began to bounce back in 2021, cash flow remained strong, taking the companies' stock prices higher and letting Ford repay high-interest debt.",1
"And the companies have cut billions in annual costs, by slashing whole lines of unprofitable sedans, withdrawing from unprofitable markets overseas, and focusing tightly on trucks, which remain the most profitable part of their business.",1
"""The existing business is good, and the driver is car prices at a record high.""",0
"The Detroit 2's financing strategy stands in stark contrast to how Tesla, then a start-up, financed its push into EVs over the last decade.",1
"The EV leader repeatedly raised money from the stock and bond markets to pay for its plans, filing paperwork with federal regulators for $10 billion in stock sales as recently as 2020.",1
"Tesla's first EV factory in California was financed with a loan that was federally guaranteed in 2010, when the EV market was nascent, before the company went public or had material revenue.",1
GM and Ford are ready to spend even more.,1
"The U.S. car market's bounce back to nearly 15 million units sold in 2021 provided the financial cushion Detroit needed to push forward aggressively, according to Nelson.",1
"""The unknown part was the pandemic.",0
The known was that we needed to be a leader in electric vehicles.'',1
"GM raised its own forecast for the full year in December, saying it will earn $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, up from $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion it had previously predicted.",1
"Ford and GM profits have held up, even though U.S. industry unit sales are off the 17 million-vehicle annual pace before Covid, because the companies aggressively cut costs to prepare for the transition, Nelson said.",1
"Ford got almost entirely out of the business of making sedans, for example, and GM laid off 4,000 salaried workers in 2019.",1
"That's in addition to factory closings that included GM's storied Lordstown, Ohio plant, later sold to EV start-up Lordstown Motors.",1
"As long ago as 2019, analysts who spoke warily of all the money Ford needed to invest in its business respectfully noted that it also had $37 billion in cash and short-term securities.",1
"The common theme: Building Ford's EV strategy around existing model names like the Mustang and especially the F-150 pickup truck, for which the company has garnered 200,000 pre-orders, is paying off in both customer acceptance and cost containment.",1
"""Within the next 24 months, based on the demand on these products, [we] would be the number two EV automaker, probably close to 600,000 EVs a year globally [from Ford's current product lineup] and we don't plan to stop there,"" Ford's North American chief operating officer Lisa Drake told a Goldman Sachs-sponsored investor conference in December.",1
"…And that's going to allow us to be more efficient with our capital and more efficient with the labor and the assembly plants.""",1
"At GM, the EV strategy includes a wave of new vehicles using new and existing nameplates – most recently, the company unveiled a $42,000 electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado SUV – as well as its Cruise joint venture with Honda, Microsoft and other investors to build an EV-centered autonomous-car business.",1
"Recently, investors made net-zero commitments, regulators developed reporting standards, governments passed laws targeting emissions, employees demanded action, and tenants demanded more sustainable buildings.",1
"At the same time, the accelerating physical consequences of a changing climate are becoming more pronounced as communities face storms, floods, fires, extreme heat, and other risks.",0
The combination of this economic transition and the physical risks of climate change has created a significant risk of mispricing real estate across markets and asset classes.,0
"Leading real-estate players will figure out which of their assets are mispriced and in what direction and use this insight to inform their investment, asset management, and disposition choices.",1
"They will also decarbonize their assets, attracting the trillions of dollars of capital that has been committed to net zero and the thousands of tenants that have made similar commitments.",1
Building climate intelligence is central to value creation and strategic differentiation in the real-estate industry.,1
But the reverse is also true: real estate is central to global climate change mitigation efforts.,0
"Approximately 11 percent of these emissions are generated by manufacturing materials used in buildings (including steel and cement), while the rest is emitted from buildings themselves and by generating the energy that powers buildings.",0
Significant reductions in emissions associated with real estate can be achieved with positive economics through technologies that already exist.,0
"Today, newer technologies also make low-carbon heating and cooling systems, such as heat pumps and energy-efficient air conditioning, more cost competitive in many markets and climates.",0
Decarbonize real-estate assets and portfolios.,1
"Create new sources of value and revenue streams for investors, tenants, and communities.",1
"More important, leaders will make a valuable contribution to the world’s ability to meet the global climate challenge.",0
"Transition risks include changes in the economy, regulation, consumer behavior, technology, and other human responses to climate change.",0
"A recent survey of finance experts and professionals conducted by researchers at New York University found that those who think real-estate asset prices reflect climate risks “not enough” outnumber those who think they reflect climate risks “too much” by 67 to 1 (in comparison with stock prices, in which the ratio was 20 to 1).",0
"Physical and transition risks can affect assets, such as buildings, directly or indirectly, by having an impact on the markets with which the assets interact.",0
"For example, a building supplied by a carbon-intensive energy grid or a carbon-intensive transportation system is exposed to the transition risks of those systems as well.",0
There is also opportunity for investors who can identify mispriced assets.,0
"According to the Journal of Urban Economics, after Hurricane Sandy, housing prices were reduced by up to 8 percent in New York’s flood zones by 2017, reflecting a greater perception of risk by potential buyers.",0
"The indirect impacts of physical risk on assets can be harder to perceive, causing some real-estate players to underestimate them.",0
"A cluster of major corporate headquarters was not directly affected, but the transportation arteries to and from the area were.",0
"This will change the structure of our economy and impact the value of the markets, companies, and companies’ locations.",1
"In June 2019, the Urban Green Council found that retrofitting all 50,000 buildings covered by the law would create retrofit demand of up to $24.3 billion through 2030.",0
"In Calgary, for example, the combination of oil price volatility and market-access issues (driven by climate change–related opposition to pipelines) has dramatically depressed revenues from some buildings.",0
Investors exposed to the Calgary market have seen their asset values drop precipitously and are left trying to either hold on and hope for a reversal of fortunes or exit the assets and take a significant loss.,0
Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.,0
Map building exposures.,0
"This could require detailed modeling of physical hazards (for example, projected changes in flood risks as the climate changes) or macro- or microeconomic modeling (for example, projected GDP impacts based on the carbon price impact on a local geography’s energy production mix).",0
Exhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.,0
"If it doesn’t successfully decarbonize, the world will experience mounting physical risks that will strain the foundations of the global economy and society.",0
"Real-estate players have a wide array of options for how to proceed, including low-carbon development and construction; building retrofits to improve energy efficiency; upgrades to heating, cooling, and lighting technology; and technology to manage demand and consumption.",1
"To develop the most appropriate path, real-estate players need to understand the range of decarbonization options and their financial and strategic costs and benefits.",1
Quantify baseline emissions of each building.,0
"This helps real-estate players prioritize where to start (for example, individual buildings, asset classes, or regions) and determine how far there is to go to reach zero emissions.",1
A marginal abatement cost curve provides a clear view of the potential cost/return on investment of a given emissions-reduction lever along with the impact of that lever on emissions reduction.,0
"These may involve making changes to financing and governance, stakeholder engagement (investors, joint-venture partners, operators, and tenants), and a range of operational and risk-management aspects of the business.",1
"Thus, much of the value of decarbonizing will come from the ability to demonstrate emissions reduction to potential stakeholders.",0
Building the ability to monitor and progressively reduce emissions on the path to net zero will create an opportunity for players to differentiate.,1
Real-estate firms can use their physical presence to generate and store energy.,1
Green buildings to attract more tenants.,1
Developers and property managers can invest in developing green buildings or retrofitting older buildings to make them green to meet the growing appetite for sustainable workplaces and homes.,1
"Firms can introduce new revenue streams, including vehicle charging, green-facilities management, and other on-site services that enable occupants’ sustainable preferences.",1
Services for reducing and tracking emissions.,0
Differentiated capital attraction.,1
"Given the volume of capital that has already been committed to achieving net zero, firms that are able to decarbonize will have an advantage in attracting capital.",1
"Real-estate players may, for example, create specific funds for net-zero buildings or investment themes that support community-scale decarbonization.",1
"Smart players will get ahead of these changes and build climate intelligence early by understanding the implications for asset values, finding opportunities to decarbonize, and creating opportunity through supporting the transition.",1
"Real estate not only will play a critical role in determining whether the world successfully decarbonizes but also will continue to reinvent the way we live, work, and play through these profound physical and economic changes.",0
"The new brand identity was developed with input from employees, healthcare practitioners and consumers and will be deployed in more than 100 markets around the world where the business operates.",1
"The creation of Haleon results from a series of successful investments and strategic changes to GSK’s consumer health business over the last 8 years, including integrations of the consumer product portfolios from Novartis and Pfizer.",1
It is now a highly valuable and focused global business generating annual sales of approximately £10 billion[1].,1
"As a standalone company, Haleon will be a new world-leader in consumer healthcare, offering a compelling proposition – to bring deep human understanding together with trusted science – to deliver better everyday health with humanity.",1
"Brian McNamara, Chief Executive Officer Designate, Haleon, said: “Introducing Haleon to the world marks another step in our journey to become a new, standalone company.",1
Our name is grounded in our purpose to deliver better everyday health with humanity and to be a world-leader in consumer healthcare.,0
We are on track to launch Haleon in mid-2022 and our business momentum is strong.,1
"Demand from the £150 billion consumer healthcare sector is strong, reflecting an increased focus on health and wellness, significant demand from an ageing population and emerging middle-class, and unmet consumer needs.",0
Employees from around the world had the opportunity to engage with the new name and brand identity which seeks to bring to life the company’s purpose and growth ambitions.,1
"The name was also announced in advance of GSK hosting a Consumer Healthcare Capital Markets Day for investors and analysts on Monday 28 February, to provide details on the overall strategy, capabilities and operations of Haleon, including detailed financial information and growth ambitions of the business.",1
"Haleon will be headquartered in Weybridge, UK, and is expected to attain a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, with ADRs to be listed in the US.",1
"The new Weybridge campus is expected to open at the end of 2024 and, alongside being the new company’s corporate headquarters, will be a centre of R&D and innovation, and home to a new state-of-the-art Shopper Science Lab.",1
"In July 2021, the Board of GSK confirmed Brian McNamara as CEO Designate and in December 2021, announced the appointment of Sir Dave Lewis as Chair Designate of the new company to result from the proposed demerger of Consumer Healthcare from GSK.",1
