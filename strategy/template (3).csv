[+] smartphone in front of a computer screen showing the META logo. - Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday announced the parent companys name is being changed to ""Meta"" to represent a future beyond just its troubled social network. The new handle comes as the social media giant tries to fend off one its worst crises yet and pivot to its ambitions for the ""metaverse"" virtual reality version of the internet that the tech giant sees as the future. (Photo by Chris DELMAS / AFP) (Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty ImagesFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that the company has changed its name to Meta — Greek for “beyond” —is an example of a marketing tactic that has been used to divert attention from an organization that has received negative publicity and is confronting a crisis situation.It’s doubtful, however, that the name change will do anything to help alleviate any of the crises or controversies now confronting the company.Mark Bayer, president of Bayer Strategic Consulting, noted that, “A name change now—when Facebook is under intense scrutiny—reinforces the perception the company is trying to elude responsibility for its lengthening list of misdeeds. Even if disconnected from the current crisis, the name change will be seen as a clumsy PR move. It’s a gift for comedy writers everywhere.”Zuckerberg said the name change was made to “reflect who we are and what we hope to build...Building our social media apps will always be an important focus for us. But right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything that we’re doing today, let alone in the future.“Over time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company. I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we’re building towards,” he said.An Apt ExampleMichael Grimm is vice president of national strategic communications firm Reputation Partners, “Conveniently, in the wake of intense scrutiny from Congress, whistleblowers, the media and public at large for the negative impact Facebook, Instagram, and its other social media websites may have on its billions of users, Facebook announced it is planning to rebrand the company with a new name,” he said.“This is interesting because it is an apt example of an often-used marketing tactic to divert attention away from negative publicity by rebranding or introducing a new identity for the company.‘Can Help Divert Negative Publicity’Grimm noted that, “Introducing a new name that can act as a parent company overseeing subsidiary groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and of course, Facebook, can help divert negative publicity to each business unit while trying to keep the overarching new brand name clean from blame and negative reputation.“We’ve seen other companies like Google do this with the creation of Alphabet. It will be up to “Meta” and Mark Zuckerberg to prove that this switch wasn’t an obvious crisis communication strategy to divert from the crises plaguing Facebook, and that it backs up its rebranding explanations for the switch with real value for consumers and shareholders,” he concluded.‘Facebook Will Still Be Facebook’Elie Jacobs, a partner at Purposeful Communications, said, “The ‘meta-answer’ is that a name change will have no bearing whatsoever on the crisis situations Facebook is facing.“Think of how few people refer to Google as Alphabet or how many people still call Altria Phillip Morris. Facebook will still be Facebook and each week will uncover yet another scandalous thing Zuckerberg & Co. have tried to cover up,” he said.Jacobs observed that, Meanwhile the stock is likely going to continue to rise until the government takes real action. While there is a long-standing Jewish tradition to rename a person going through life-threatening medical challenges, I dont think Zuckerberg had that in mind. I dont think the lesson for business leaders here is renaming equals rebirth...”‘Timing Feels Strange’Business consultant Jeff Pedowitz said, “I think the timing feels strange given the recent scrutiny the company is under. Name change aside, the company has a lot of work to do to rebuild trust and confidence in consumers and demonstrate that it can really protect privacy while maintaining balanced and fair standards that are applied to everyone, not just select individuals.“They need to take tangible steps to reaffirm the brand promise. Demonstrate real transparency and accountability. Right now they are papering over the issues and everyone sees right through it. They should consider replacing some of their key executives and invest in outside agencies to review and provide oversight of their changes. That would go a long way to demonstrating they are serious about improving their image and what they really stand for.”‘A Classic Redirection’Christopher Tompkins, the CEO and founder of The Go! Agency, said “Facebooks decision to change the platforms name is a classic redirection to pull attention away from not only what the public perceives, but what every marketing professional knows. There are more changes going on behind the scenes than the public at large know. They are not really money-motivated monsters. Power is what they are looking for, and gaining.“Business leaders can learn the lesson that redirection is a powerful tool to hide the tarnishes on their brand, but it is how you sell it and get buy-in from their true audience that matters most. In this case, the opinion will be divided,” he predicted.No Impact On BrandTerry M. Isner, owner and CEO of Jaffe PR, said, “A name change or a logo change does not change a brand. It can’t hide or erase the past with a face lift. If the perception is that they are using it to remove themselves from past issues, they are actually giving more life to that thought process by making this change opposed to deflecting it because they hope everybody will be distracted by a new shiny name and logo.”‘Shining A Light On Their Problems’Isner said, ““They are shining a spotlight on their problems, while also creating more doubt around the brand. The name “Facebook” associated the tool with people and humanity and a need to collaborate, share and connect. “Meta"" actually fits as a name, as it appears they are moving towards a data driven platform and not connecting people.“This feels similar to Disney’s latest issues, as they both seem to be going the wrong way while rest of the world is focusing on connecting, empathizing, and staying relevant by being, and putting, people first. It seems these CEOs are trusting in data and not the user. If this was a long time coming and the change has value, I think they blew it by making the change now,” he said."
Business strategy change,https://hbr.org/2021/11/facebooks-rebrand-has-a-fundamental-problem,Facebook’s Rebrand Has a Fundamental Problem,"Facebook’s decision to rebrand is an ill-timed move but not for the reason you might think. The author argues that the real problem is that Facebook is re-branding before its vision is a reality. Right now, social media remains the core of the company’s operations and revenues. By adopting a brand name that is based on future potential capabilities and a platform and products that, by Zuckerberg’s own admission, may not be offered for a decade, the company sets itself up to confuse people at best; at worst, it will disappoint people and further degrade their trust in the company. Today’s customers demand authenticity from the brands they do business with, and they expect companies to be on the inside what they say they are on the outside.Last week Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his company is changing its name to Meta. The rebrand has been panned for many reasons: it’s a foolish attempt to distract from the criticism the company has recently faced; the metaverse that the new name refers to is not well-known or understood, so it’s confusing; Meta is a stupid company name, etc. But the most critical issue with this rebranding is that the new brand has been introduced without any substantive change at the company.Zuckerberg explained the rebrand during his address at the company’s virtual event, Facebook Connect, saying, “It is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything we do.” But, that’s just not true. The vision behind Meta is still just that: a vision. Right now, social media remains the core of the company’s operations and revenues. By adopting a brand name that is based on future potential capabilities and a platform and products that, by Zuckerberg’s own admission, may not be established for nearly a decade, the company sets itself up to confuse people at best; at worst, it will disappoint people and further degrade their trust in the company.It’s not surprising that Facebook would take this tact; many companies do. When business leaders want to change their company’s identity or reposition their business, they often turn to external messaging and communications first — a new name, a fresh logo, an advertising campaign. That’s because these kinds of surface-level changes are relatively easy to make; it’s much more difficult to make real changes to the business and company culture.There might have been a time in the past when a corporate makeover was effective at changing public opinion. Today’s customers are much savvier. They must be offered something substantially different or see reliable evidence problems have been fixed before they will believe that the company has actually changed. They demand authenticity from the brands they do business with, and they expect companies to be on the inside what they say they are on the outside.By adopting a new name, Facebook may be trying to claim that it is developing innovative technologies that bring people together in new and exciting ways. But in reality, it is a company that is building and promoting potentially dangerous products, harboring a dysfunctional workforce culture, and losing the faith of its customers. It should have waited until it addressed these problems, and more importantly, established itself as a provider of metaverse products or applications before announcing a new brand.That’s what Google did when its corporate entity was rebranded to Alphabet in 2015. Over many years leading up the change, Google’s business had expanded well beyond its search engine product. When the company adopted its new name, it had already become a tech conglomerate comprised of a wide range of companies and products including driverless cars, medical devices, and smart home appliances. As a result, the brand change not only made sense, but it also effectively minimized the associations between Google and its sister companies, shielding Google from concerns from the public raised about emerging technologies (“creepy” drones, dangerous autonomous vehicles, etc.) and shielding the other entities from the profit expectations of Wall Street placed on Google.Despite its new name, Facebook cannot effectively create any separation between its social media business and the metaverse and other developments because the latter are only in their infancy.Of course, not all companies rely on name changes to repair their public images. Consider Microsoft’s transformation. When CEO Satya Nadella set out to remake the company and address its critics, the company embraced AI, mobile, and cloud-first strategies; opened itself up to partnerships (e.g., Linux); aggressively pursued acquisitions (e.g., LinkedIn); and implemented digital transformation across its operations. Most importantly, Nadella transformed the company culture from one characterized by infighting and inertia to a learning organization that thrives on collaboration and customer-obsession. And yet, Microsoft hasn’t felt the need to change its name or launch any kind of corporate campaign to promote the changes. Instead, it has relied on its operational and culture changes to resurrect its business and shift public opinion. There’s no indication that anything similar is currently percolating at Facebook.Many people refer to a brand as a promise; but a brand must be a promise delivered. With its rebranding effort, Facebook is making promises that it doesn’t seem able to deliver right now. Until it shows that it’s making real changes, Meta will just be the same old Facebook by another name."
Business strategy change,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/business/johnson-johnson-split.html,"Johnson & Johnson, Iconic Company Under Pressure, Plans to Split in Two","At the same time, Johnson & Johnson was also under public and legal fire for its role in the opioid crisis. The company was a manufacturer of potentially addictive opiate painkillers, a business it discontinued entirely in the United States last year. It faces lawsuits seeking billions of dollars, though courts in California and Oklahoma recently handed victories to Johnson & Johnson and other opioid makers.Johnson & Johnson, like other medical companies, has weathered its share of reputation-threatening controversies. In a 1982 episode that became a textbook example of how to manage a corporate crisis, the company had to scramble after someone tampered with capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol, turning them lethal with potassium cyanide and killing seven people. The company regained public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging.Throughout, the company has relied on the “halo effect” created by popular consumer products, none more so than its Johnson’s Baby line of shampoos, lotions, moisturizers and powder for infants. Such products have thin profit margins but have embossed public perceptions of Johnson & Johnson as a benevolent, gentle company.“It gives us a wonderful image that most companies would kill for,” Ralph S. Larsen, the company’s chairman at the time, told Forbes in 2001.But the commercial value of those brands has weakened over time. Even as consumers continue to refer to all plastic bandages as Band-Aids — the rare brand, like Kleenex and Xerox, whose name is a stand-in for an entire range of products — they have embraced cheaper, generic rivals. The same is true for products like Tylenol.Even lingering affection for the company’s consumer products does not do much to advance Johnson & Johnson’s medical businesses, which are far more important to the company’s finances."
Business strategy change,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/blackrock-is-overhauling-its-strategy-to-focus-on-climate-change.html,Here's how the world's largest money manager is overhauling its strategy because of climate change,"BlackRock is overhauling its investing strategy to make sustainability the ""new standard for investing,"" which will include launching new active and passively-managed funds that focus on socially responsible investing. In his highly anticipated annual letter to company executives, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a ""fundamental reshaping of finance"" is underway as issues like climate change ""become a defining factor in companies long-term prospects."" Fink argues that sustainable-focused investing strategies make sense not just from a social perspective, but an economic one. Climate change poses a real risk to long-term viability, and companies can no longer afford to ignore these risks. BlackRock is the worlds largest money manager — at the end of 2019s third quarter it had nearly $7 trillion in assets under management — which means that the companys policies have significant reach. But BlackRocks sheer size is also in some respects limiting. Since the company offers exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500, for example, its difficult to unilaterally sell stocks of companies that engage in activities that might not align with a customers values. This is not the first time Fink has used his annual letter to push for change. In 2018 he said that companies must focus on more than just making money, and in 2019 he argued that companies need to take positions on societal issues. This time around, his letter feels more immediate, since the company also announced a host of new initiatives, including doubling its exchange traded funds, or ETFs, that focus on companies environmental, social and governance factors, or ESG. The firm is also moving away from thermal coal companies.""Because sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, we are making sustainability integral to the way BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies,"" the firms global executive committee, which includes Fink, wrote in its letter to clients Tuesday. ""We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing."" BlackRock already offers sustainable investing strategies, but its new products are designed to make it even easier for investors to choose socially responsible funds. ""We want to make sustainable investing more accessible to all investors and lower the hurdles for those who want to act,"" the letter said.Sustainable-focused portfoliosBlackRock said that beginning this year, it will offer sustainable versions of its flagship portfolios, with the eventual goal being to make the sustainable option the ""flagship"" offering. Instead of optimizing for market cap-weighted exposure, these funds will instead focus on ESG-optimized exposure. The company also plans to expand its offerings of sustainability-focused passive funds, as well as its impact investing arm. This includes its Global Impact Equity fund, which is set to launch this quarter. ""Clients are now asking us more and more questions about climate change,"" Fink said Tuesday on CNBCs ""Squawk Box."" ""As the largest investment firm in the world, it was very clear to me that more and more clients are looking for advice from us,"" Fink said. ""Probably the most important inference from my observations is I believe we are just beginning a major reallocation of capital.""Doubling down on ESGBlackRock said that stocks and other assets are already evaluated through an ESG-lens, but announced that these factors will play a greater role in the decision-making process. ESG risk will be evaluated ""with the same rigor"" as ""traditional measures such as credit and liquidity risk."" As ESG-focused investing has grown in popularity so, too, have critics of the style, who argue that the inherently subjective nature means theres little accountability. BlackRock said that portfolio managers will be accountable for ""documenting how those considerations have affected investment decisions,"" noting that its part of a wider push to be more transparent. ""By the end of 2020, we intend to provide transparent, publicly available data on sustainability characteristics – including data on controversial holdings and carbon footprint – for BlackRock mutual funds,"" the firm said.Removing coalAs part of its stricter ESG strategy, BlackRock said it would move money away from high-risk sectors, including the thermal coal industry. The company said its divesting from companies that generate more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production — or coal used for power production — from its actively managed portfolio, which it hopes to complete by the middle of 2020. This extends to the firms alternative business, which BlackRock said will make no future direct investments in companies focused on thermal coal production.New ETF offeringsTo increase accessibility to sustainable products, BlackRock said that it will more than double its ESG-focused ETFs to 150 funds over the next few years. This includes sustainable versions of the firms flagship index products, and there will also be options to screen out specific sectors entirely. BlackRock also said that it will work with index providers ""to promote greater standardization and transparency of sustainability benchmark methodology.""Enhancing voter engagementThe firm said that it will step up its engagement with company management on sustainability-related factors, and that starting this quarter it will disclose shareholder voting on a quarterly rather than annual basis. ""On key high-profile votes, we will disclose our vote promptly, along with an explanation of our decision,"" the management team said, while adding that it will ""enhance the disclosure of our company engagements by including in our stewardship annual report the topics we discussed during each engagement with a company.""Is it enough?"

Business strategy change,https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/20746-kraft-heinz-co-entering-phase-three-of-growth-strategy,Kraft Heinz Co. entering phase three of growth strategy,"CHICAGO – When Miguel Patricio took over as chief executive officer of the Kraft Heinz Co. he sought to turn the company around by realigning its product portfolio and using its scale to improve results. Now Kraft Heinz is entering phase three of his strategy and plans to embed agility into the organization with digital technologies that will improve customer service, innovation and marketing initiatives.“The first two phases of our transformation were designed to bring scale and agility together,” Mr. Patricio said Feb. 22 during a presentation at the virtual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference. “It had mainly been an internally focused process to get established best practices in place and bring us to industry standards.“We focused on capabilities, processes and disciplines that, in many ways, were new to Kraft Heinz, but not necessarily new to the world. This has allowed us to close the gap against best-in-class standards of efficiency and execution across the value chain.”The company is calling phase three of its strategy Agile@Scale and Mr. Patricio said it will enable Kraft Heinz to accelerate the pace of innovation with better, more meaningful customer insights, and use company resources more efficiently.“In other words, we are building a more powerful engine to supercharge our operating model,” Mr. Patricio said. “So, same transformation strategy, same proven operating model, better engine. Agile@Scale is how we will go about opening new growth opportunities and unlocking greater efficiencies. This will lead to generating meaningful free cash flow.”Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera, president of Kraft Heinz’s North America business unit, said the company has been investing in its “tech ecosystem” to maximize value creation by upgrading and scaling partner solutions, upgrading internal solutions and launching a digital lab to build new digital solutions.“This is not just about speed,” he said. “We’re striving for sustainable innovation that will meaningfully contribute to our market share.”An example of the company’s new strategy may be seen in its recent acquisition of Just Spices, Dusseldorf, Germany. Just Spices is a manufacturer of spices, spice blends, salad dressings and meal kits, and approximately 70% of the company’s sales are direct-to-consumer.“Just Spices brings a proven AI (artificial intelligence) solution and differentiated approach to spices with a focus on recipes and (that targets) younger consumers through a fully integrated direct-to-consumer marketplace,” Mr. Abrams-Rivera said.The second area of focus will be to engage consumers using insights generated by real-time data across internal and external sources.“We are creating a much deeper and granular level of understanding of our consumers, who they are, their needs and their behaviors,” Mr. Abrams-Rivera said. “From here, we can tailor our content and approach, so we reach consumers with the right message at the right time, all while deepening our connection to turn engagement into conversions and consumer loyalty.”Embedding agility into the organization also will allow it to better serve customers. Mr. Abrams-Rivera said that one year ago Kraft Heinz was managing between 60% and 70% variability in its shipments.“Having variability this sizable did not fully meet our customer needs as we would frequently run the risk of out of stocks,” he said. “As a solution, we created a Kraft Heinz proprietary ecosystem to design the perfect shipment. The first step was to ingest approximately 50 data sources, aggregating internal data, like historical inventory turnover, trade promotions and sales activity, alongside external data, such macroeconomic factors like weather to create demand planning view all the way down to the store and SKU (stock-keeping unit) level.“Using this as our base, we then developed an AI power system to learn the patterns of inventory rotation, coupled with the internal and external factors that caused the rotation. The system then provides a recommendation of the optimal shipment at a granular level, providing each store with the product they needed, while accounting for availability and demand.”The results of the initiative, according to the company, have been a three- to five-point improvement in shipment mix accuracy that will eventually result in $100 million in efficiencies, lower inventory levels and better customer service.“But thats just the beginning,” Mr. Abrams-Rivera said. “The perfect shipment tool will evolve to predict and anticipate future consumer and customer needs by constantly changing signals in the database, connecting our supply chain and recommended shipments that can drive incremental upside.”Taking its new growth strategy into account, Kraft Heinz Co. updated its long-term financial outlook with organic net sales growth going from 1% to 2% to 2% to 3%; adjusted EBITDA is rising from 2% to 3% to 4% to 6%; and adjusted earnings per share were raised from 4% to 6% to 6% to 8%."
Business strategy change,https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00195,Changing Structures and Behaviors at Walgreens,"Change is never easy, and when you’re a 112-year-old enterprise like Walgreen Company (“Walgreens”), it’s even less so. For most of the past three decades, our success came from expanding our retail footprint. That was our business strategy. We called it “seven by 10,” meaning we wanted to have 7,000 stores by 2010. In fact, we beat that goal—going from 4,250 stores in 2003 to 7,000 in 2009. At our peak, we were opening a store every 17 hours.To support the seven-by-10 strategy, we had some well-refined capabilities. For example, we were very good at managing real estate, including construction and analytics. We could tell you almost anything about any street corner in the United States. We could predict, within 3 percent, the volume for a potential new location in various categories, including pharmacy and front-end sales.The old Walgreens business strategy required a command-and-control approach to leadership. We set out clear processes for our employees, and they followed them. It was straightforward and effective for the task at hand, and it worked for a long time. But then the competitive landscape changed. New rivals entered the market, such as third-party pharmacy benefits management companies that deliver prescriptions by mail. More grocers started offering in-store pharmacies. An even bigger challenge was the growth of Internet pure plays, like Amazon and Google, which sell most of what we carry. All of these had the potential to lure customers out of our stores.At the same time, we started to see significant changes in healthcare, which ultimately resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the advent of accountable care organizations. Throw in the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we knew we had to change our strategy. In this new market, with the huge push to improve quality and reduce overall healthcare costs, Walgreens had a significant opportunity to become a player in the healthcare value chain. As a result, we evolved from simply filling prescriptions for people to becoming a single point of patient care, and a destination for health and daily-living products and services for our customers.To succeed in this new role, we had to change our business strategy. Instead of relying on a real estate play—location, location, location—we focused on improving the customer experience. As our strategy evolved and our focus changed from opening stores to delivering an exceptional customer experience, we recognized that not only was the command-and-control approach outdated, but it also prevented us from getting the best from our people. We were missing the richness of empowering them to come up with solutions on their own.We looked around at other retail players known for delivering a quality experience. It’s strange—people have an emotional connection to a cup of coffee. We provided healthcare and didn’t see that emotional connection anywhere in the drugstore space. Our market research data also told us that customers didn’t perceive differences among the major drug retail chains. We realized that we could really differentiate ourselves based on the experience we delivered. This represented a fundamental change in how we engaged with our market. We wanted to be more than a simple retail chain—we wanted to be an experience provider.To execute that strategy, however, we needed to redesign some components of the organization. We had to focus our frontline and field leadership on coaching employees and creating the right customer interactions. And we had to free up time among leaders to enable this. This was only partly a structural issue. We’d clearly need to redefine roles, but we also knew that some of our incentives weren’t aligned with the new behaviors we wanted among the field employees. Decisions were an issue too; leaders spent too much time making decisions that could be better handled elsewhere.Our fundamental goal was to build a high-performance culture at every level of our field operations. With that in mind, we decided on a few priorities for the redesign. First, we’d make structural changes to free up the leaders’ time and better support them. Second, we had to change decision rights so that the right approvals were happening in the right places. Next came incentives; we had to change the way that we motivated and rewarded people, to emphasize employee engagement and customer satisfaction. Finally, we had to develop mechanisms that could change long-established mind-sets and norms—not just changing operational details but putting in place coaching, support networks, and a new performance management model. It was a big undertaking, especially with 240,000 employees.A More Supportive StructureAnother goal was to provide extra support for our district managers, so they could focus on improving engagement with employees and customers. Given that each district manager oversees almost 1,000 people, managing, developing, and operating the business can be a challenge. Those managers were the main intermediary between the corporate office and our retail locations.We had recognized years before that although Walgreens had centralized processes for functions including HR, IT, employee relations, and finance, we couldn’t make all those decisions at the corporate level. We didn’t understand local environments enough, and one-size-fits-all policies just didn’t work well sometimes. But as we increased local decision making, district managers found themselves taking on more of that work at their level, without sufficient support. Those responsibilities pulled them away from the stores, which is where they most needed to be. Providing those managers with the critical support they needed became crucial to our success.So we put two new roles into the organization hierarchy. First, for each of our 30 U.S. markets, we created a position called vice president for markets, located in the field (the local geography). We did this to move corporate-level leadership closer to the customer. These individuals represent the main link between corporate headquarters and field operations. To support them, and to bring market-level resources closer to the customer’s experience, we also moved functions such as HR, IT, real estate, employee relations, and finance to the field. Along with these departments, we gave every market its own profit and loss responsibility. This really drove accountability at the local level.The second role we added was community leader. These people serve as mentors to less experienced store managers; they offer training and help them implement new service offerings. We had tried to improve customer service in the past. Some of those programs had been fantastic, but without the right framework and leadership to sustain them, they didn’t last. With this effort, community leaders are really driving the changes.Elevated Decision RightsFor the new strategy to succeed, store managers needed to focus less on operational activities, such as HR and vendor relationships, and more on employee engagement: coaching their people and helping them engage with customers. So we moved some decisions that had been located within the field management structure higher up. Merchandising, for example, had formerly been handled at a store-by-store level, but now it’s handled at headquarters. With this adjustment, managers have more time to work on the company’s new priorities—employee engagement and improving the customer experience.Another goal was to develop management skills at the store level, so those people could make solid decisions that were right for their community. Every store is unique. Some are swamped in the morning, for example, and some don’t have their first customer until 11 o’clock. Store managers are more equipped and supported to meet their community’s needs.Norms of EngagementIn the past, we had really strong policies and procedures, but our model didn’t allow for innovation or empowered customer service. Store employees simply executed preset tasks. Now, the way we do things is different. At the store level, we don’t want employees to simply complete tasks. We want them to come up with new ideas, and new ways of helping the customers.This requires a big shift in leadership. Our model of the ideal executive has gone from an authoritative leader who could get new stores up and running fast, to an engaged leader who can hold people accountable, develop them, and manage them. That shift changes the way every employee comes to work each day.Motivators for AccountabilityA big part of the redesign was to help employees understand how this was different from what they did before, what they would be expected to do going forward, and how they would be evaluated and rewarded. In the past, everything was simple. We based our bonus and advancement system purely on financial performance—meaning how sales and profit numbers matched expectations. Leadership skills were not a priority; if your numbers were up, we considered you a hero.With this shift, we set up a true pay-for-performance system, including incentives to drive the behaviors we wanted. Leadership at Walgreens today carries a different expectation and is rewarded accordingly. Under the new system, leaders are evaluated and bonuses are set according to three key critical areas: financial results, team member engagement, and customer service. There’s also a percentage that accounts for community engagement and events. We think that’s crucial for building ties to local markets, which is why we make it part of the bonus system. In each of the past two years, our stores have participated in almost 16,000 community events, totaling a little over a million volunteer hours.There’s another component to accountability: managing underperformers. When we looked at other chains with strong customer service, we saw a very highly engaged workforce, but we also saw HR processes that allowed the company to identify employees who weren’t doing well, address that performance, and, if necessary, move them out quickly. We hadn’t had those policies in place before. We’ve now addressed these issues. We’re clear about the new expectations regarding the treatment of customers, and we’re training employees to meet those standards.Networks to Drive ChangeToday we have stronger networks designed to drive change from the ground up. We recognize how valuable it is for our folks to collaborate and communicate closely on a daily basis. So we designed some network-enhancing activities to drive the change, share best practices, and build ties to the community. For instance, we instituted five-minute meetings every day, in every store. These are opportunities for the staff to talk about where the store is winning and where it needs help. What are the big ideas, and what are the expectations for the day? If we provide the right training and leadership, the store managers and employees will come up with the answers they need on their own—the right solution for their location and market.We also implemented “store walks,” in which market vice presidents and district managers visit stores in their markets and determine what’s working well and what’s not. They share ideas that have worked well elsewhere. There are more formal elements—we have market leadership meetings every other month, where people can share ideas—but walk-throughs at the store level are where the field transformation really happens.We also want store employees to talk to one another more. One of the questions in our employee engagement survey is “Do you have a best friend at work?” We want that kind of social connection, because it’s a big part of how our employees grow and remain engaged, which translates to a better experience for our customers, and for them.Some of these ideas were developed during the pilot phase, when we were figuring out how best to establish new leadership and performance behaviors. But they worked so well in the pilot that we rolled them out to the entire company. And now that we’ve built up these networks, they’re an asset that we can use in the future, to drive other changes we want to make.The Roster of ResultsThis initiative has required a lot of work. There’s a huge change-management effort to make sure the initiatives are sustainable, and we’ve spent about US$30 million on training alone, with more to come. However, a year into the implementation phase, the results are promising. In our pilot program, we went from the bottom 25 percent to the 95th percentile in our engagement survey results.The Gallup Organization, which measured the results for us, actually thought the numbers were wrong because they’d never seen such a big improvement in one year. We’ll have the next results after the full rollout in 2013. Our service levels are at an all-time high. We think next year will be even better—everyone now understands the larger strategy, we have targets in place, and company bonuses will be awarded against those targets.Financially, the first year under this project was one of our best in the past decade. We also have a lot of anecdotes that show that the re-design is moving us in the right direction. Many of them have to do with seemingly small things we ignored in the past. For example, we used to expect our store clerks to be efficient. Now we encourage them to cultivate the kind of friendliness that will attract customers.In one of our stores in Texas, a register clerk named Francelle is known for her friendliness and presence. She knows many customers by name. Francelle took some time off for a few weeks and, boy, did our customers notice. They asked about her daily. “Where’s Francelle? Is everything OK?” That kind of connection with customers, which you might expect from a neighborhood shop, was rare for us in the past. We didn’t think it was important. Now we think it’s the kind of connection that will determine our future."

And hes also refreshing the circle of executives who sit closest to him.Peloton confirmed to CNBC that on Friday it will start to trial a new pricing system, where customers pay a single monthly fee for both their workout equipment and for access to Pelotons on-demand fitness classes. Should a user choose to cancel, Peloton would take back the Bike.The test will run for a period of time in Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Denver, for monthly fees ranging between $60 and $100. Customers will only be able to choose this option through Pelotons brick-and-mortar stores, or its fitness studios, and not online.Peloton also announced Thursday that it has hired Andrew Rendich, former chief operating officer of the e-commerce company Grove Collaborative, as its chief supply chain officer, effective next week. It also said that its current global head of people, Shari Eaton, has been promoted to chief people officer, reporting directly to McCarthy.The company is trying to win over skeptical investors. At least one Wall Street analyst has already questioned whether the new pricing plan could end up weighing on Pelotons brand and finances. The companys shares are down 80% over the past 12 months. In recent weeks, the stock has been trading below its IPO price of $29, and closed Thursday at $22.61.Peloton spokeswoman Amelise Lane said Peloton created the limited-time pilot in select markets in the United States to explore various pricing models and options for new members.""This aligns with Pelotons belief that intuition drives testing and data drives decision making as the company sets course for the next phase of its evolution and growth,"" Lane said in an emailed statement.Peloton members who also own a piece of the companys equipment pay a monthly fee of $39 to access workout classes, including cycling, meditation, yoga and running. Digital-only members pay $12.99 per month.The bigger upfront expense comes with the companys equipment. Pelotons original Bike currently costs $1,745, including delivery and setup fees, while its Bike+ retails for $2,495. The company last August had cut the price of its Bike by about 20% to $1,495, not including delivery, hoping to appeal to more consumers with a cheaper option. It also offers financing through Affirm.McCarthy has already made it very clear, too, that prices could fall further as he aims to grow Pelotons user base beyond the Covid pandemic.The former Netflix and Spotify exec, who took over the CEO role from Peloton co-founder John Foley, has been tasked with getting Peloton back to profitability, as the company grapples with waning demand for at-home workout products and heightened supply chain expenses.Rendich, Pelotons incoming supply chain chief, also notably served more than 12 years with Netflix, including chief service and operations officer roles.""I think theres enormous opportunity for us to flex the business model and dramatically increase the [total addressable market] for new members by lowering the cost of entry and playing around with the relationship between the monthly recurring revenue and the upfront revenue,"" McCarthy said in an interview with CNBCs Jim Cramer last month.While the bundled pricing strategy is only a test, and its unclear if and when Peloton would incorporate this idea permanently, BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel raised questions about the damage it could do to Pelotons financials and to its brand image.""For a company that has been plagued with logistic issues, they are now effectively allowing people to return their piece of equipment, at a moments notice,"" Siegel said. ""Theyre actually throwing themselves more into the delivery and logistics game. Rather than walking away from it.""Further, Siegel said Peloton has, to its credit, been able to keep churn rates so low because people dont want to quit the service once they make such a significant purchase for one of its bikes or treadmill machines. Pelotons average net monthly connected fitness churn was 0.79% in the latest period.""But if it becomes easy to cancel, and easy to return, whats that going to do to churn?"" Siegel said. ""Does Peloton become a winter experience for customers who every year rent the bike for four months, and then give it back when the weathers nice? That becomes a very expensive customer.""One user also asked in a Reddit thread about the pricing test if Peloton would, as a result, change the membership fee for people who already own the companys equipment.As of Dec. 31, Peloton counted 2.77 million connected fitness subscribers. It has more than 6.6 million total members, including those people who only pay for access to its workout classes.In another bid to win customers, Peloton recently extended its free at-home trial for its Bike, Bike+ and Tread machines to 100 days from 30.The company also has new cardio products on the way, including a strength training device called Peloton Guide and a rowing machine. By manufacturing a suite of connected fitness options, Peloton aims to be a tougher competitor to rivals such as Hydrow, Tonal and Lululemons Mirror. Its hope is that people who already own a Bike or a Tread will buy more stuff within the Peloton ecosystem, including its own apparel.When McCarthy took over as CEO, he wrote in a memo to employees that Peloton had to find ways to drive growth. ""And that will require us to take risks, to be willing to fail quickly, to learn quickly, to adapt and evolve quickly, rinse and repeat,"" he said.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the pricing tests."
Business strategy change,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/14/netflix-considers-ads-password-sharing-crackdown-live-sports.html,"Netflix, once the great disruptor, is now taking ideas from the industry it upended to jumpstart growth","In this article NFLXReed Hastings, co-founder and chief executive officer of Netflix Inc., during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 18, 2021. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNetflix executives are now reflecting on how they failed to adjust to a new competitive reality, one which was masked by massive subscriber gains during the Covid pandemic when billions of people around the world were stuck at home. While the company has consistently churned out big hits, such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Squid Game,"" Netflix is rethinking many of the philosophies that disrupted the industry more than a decade ago. The change in strategy, even on the margins, is a surprising one for a company best known for disrupting two industries — first video rental and then cable TV. Instead of inventing new ways to upend whats become a crowded streaming video industry, Netflix is reconsidering nearly all of the ways it stood out from legacy media companies in the first place. In other words, Hastings has decided his best strategy now is to un-disrupt. ""Its notable that Netflix is seeking growth by rethinking many of its firmly held beliefs,"" said Joel Mier, Netflixs director of marketing from 1999 to 2006 and a lecturer in marketing at the University of Richmond. ""These decisions will clearly help revenue and subscriber growth in the short- to mid-term. The larger question is how they will impact the firms brand over the long-term."" Netflix declined to comment.Embracing advertisingHastings has long proclaimed Netflixs aversion to advertising is due to the added complexity of the business. ""Advertising looks easy until you get in it,"" Hastings said in 2020. ""Then you realize you have to rip that revenue away from other places because the total ad market isnt growing, and in fact right now its shrinking. Its hand-to-hand combat to get people to spend less on, you know, ABC and to spend more on Netflix. We went public 20 years ago at about a dollar a share, and now were [more than] $500. So I would say our subscription-focused strategys worked pretty well."" Netflix is no longer more than $500 a share. It closed at $169.69 on Monday. Since making that comment in 2020, Hastings has watched other streaming services, including Warner Bros. Discoverys HBO Max, NBCUniversals Peacock and Paramount Globals Paramount+, launch lower-priced services with ads without a consumer backlash. Disney plans to unveil a cheaper ad-supported Disney+ later this year.A sign is posted in front of Netflix headquarters on April 20, 2022 in Los Gatos, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn April, Hastings announced hed changed his mind. An ad-supported Netflix ""makes a lot of sense"" for ""consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising tolerant,"" he said. Netflix has previously argued it found a gap in the market by not worrying about advertising. Niche shows, which wouldnt play well with advertisers, who want scale, could be valuable for Netflix if they brought in enough subscribers relative to production budgets. It remains to be seen whether Netflix will offer its full slate of content on an ad-supported service or if certain shows will be walled off for no-ad subscribers only.Developing showsPart of Netflixs pitch to content creators has been ordering ""straight to series,"" rather than making traditional pilot episodes of shows and judging them based on a hard product. Other streamers have followed suit after seeing Netflix attract A-list talent by skipping pilots. ""If youre a typical studio, you raise money for a pilot, and if it tests well, you pick up the show, maybe you make a few more episodes, and you wait for the ratings,"" Barry Enderwick, who worked in Netflixs marketing department from 2001 to 2012 and who was director of global marketing and subscriber acquisition, told CNBC in 2018. ""At Netflix, our data made our decisions for us, so wed just order two seasons. Show creators would ask us, Do you want to see notes? Dont you want to see a pilot? Wed respond, If you want us to. Creators were gobsmacked."" Ordering projects straight to series gave writers and producers certainty and, frequently, more money. The downside, Netflix has found, is its also led to series that didnt turn out to be very good. Deadline noted 47 different examples of Netflix ordering straight to series in 2020-21 and 20 for 2022. While a few are notable, such as ""The Witcher: Blood Origin"" and ""That 90s Show,"" most have generated little buzz. Netflix plans to start ordering more pilots and slow down on its straight-to-series development process, according to people familiar with the matter. The hope is the end result will lead to higher-quality programming and less fluff. Netflix doesnt plan to lower its overall budget on content. Still, it does intend to reallocate money to focus on quality after years of adding quantity to fill its library, the people said. Executives have added more original programming in recent years to avoid a lasting reliance on licensed content — much of which has been pulled back by the media companies who own it to fill their own streaming services.Appointment viewingAnother Netflix hallmark has been its long-held decision to release full seasons of series all at once, allowing users to watch episodes at their own pace. ""Theres no reason to release it weekly,"" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in 2016. ""The move away from appointment television is enormous. So why are you going to drag people back to something theyre abandoning in huge numbers?""Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 08, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesStill, in recent years, Netflix has experimented with weekly releases for some reality shows instead of bulk drops. Thus far, this hasnt extended to scripted streaming. Read more: Netflixs binge-release model is under new scrutiny ""We fundamentally believe that we want to give our members the choice in how they view,"" Peter Friedlander, Netflixs head of scripted series for U.S. and Canada, said earlier this month. ""And so giving them that option on these scripted series to watch as much as they want to watch when they watch it, is still fundamental to what we want to provide."" But people familiar with the matter said Netflix will continue to play around with weekly releases for certain types of series, such as reality TV and other shows based on competition. Netflixs resistance to weekly scripted release may be the next thing to go.Live sportsNetflix has always rejected bidding on live sports, a staple of legacy media companies. ""To follow a competitor, never, never, never,"" Hastings said in 2018. ""We have so much we want to do in our area, so were not trying to copy others, whether thats linear cable, theres lots of things we dont do. We dont do (live) news, we dont do (live) sports. But what we do do, we try to do really well."" Yet, last year, Hastings said Netflix will consider bidding on live Formula One rights to pair with the success of its documentary series ""Drive to Survive,"" which profiles each racing season.Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB18 to the grid before the F1 Grand Prix of Emilia Romagna at Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari on April 24, 2022 in Imola, Italy. Dan Istitene - Formula 1 | Formula 1 | Getty Images""A few years ago, the rights to Formula 1 were sold,"" Hastings said to German magazine Der Spiegel in September. ""At that time we were not among the bidders, today we would think about it."" This month, Business Insider reported Netflix has been holding talks with Formula One for months for U.S. broadcast rights. Adding live sports may give Netflix a new audience base, but it flies in the face of Netflixs recent aversion to spending big money on licensed programming.Limiting password sharingFor many years, Netflix dismissed password sharing as a quirky side issue that merely demonstrated the popularity of its product. In 2017, Netflixs corporate account tweeted ""Love is sharing a password."" But as Netflixs growth has slowed, executives see password-sharing crackdowns as a new engine to reinvigorate revenue growth. ""Were working on how to monetize sharing. Weve been thinking about that for a couple of years,"" Hastings said during the companys April earnings conference call. ""But when we were growing fast, it wasnt the high priority to work on. And now, were working super hard on it."" Over the next year, Netflix plans to charge accounts that are clearly shared with users outside the home additional fees. ""Were not trying to shut down that sharing, but were going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her and so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing,"" Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said during the same call, adding it will ""allow us to bring in revenue for everyone whos viewing and who gets value from the entertainment that were offering."" CNBC reported earlier on how the password-sharing crackdown is likely to work.No longer pure-play streamingNetflix has become famous for its 2009 culture presentation, which laid out the companys values. One of the companys core tenets speaks to innovation. ""You keep us nimble by minimizing complexity and finding time to simplify."" Netflix has benefited from being a pure-play streaming company for years. While other media companies, such as Disney, have lagged because of a conglomerate discount and slow-growing or declining legacy assets, investors have loved Netflixs one-trick pony: streaming growth. But that, too, is slowly changing. Netflix announced last year its dabbling in video games. Netflix currently has 22 video games on its platform and aims to have 50 by year end. Adding a new vertical to streaming video may help Netflix give investors a new reason to bet on the companys future growth. But it also potentially cuts at a long-held Hastings tenet: that focusing on movies and TV shows is what sets Netflix apart. ""What we have to do is be the specialty play,"" Hastings told CNBC in 2017. ""We focus on how do we be, really, the embodiment of entertainment, and joy, and movies and TV shows.""

Business strategy change,https://www.flightglobal.com/airframers/boeing-to-restructure-simplify-corporate-functions-amid-changing-industry/138008.article,"Boeing to restructure, simplify corporate functions amid changing industry","Boeing is overhauling some of its management structure in an effort to streamline and integrate functions, improve cost efficiency and better prepare the company to succeed after the coronavirus pandemic.“We will recover from this crisis, but positioning ourselves now for what will be a significantly smaller, and more competitive, industry after the pandemic subsides requires us to resize, reshape and continuously review our business – starting at the top with our leadership structure,” says a Boeing official.The overhaul, announced 21 April, includes formation of a new group called “Enterprise Operations, Finance and Strategy”. That division will be led by chief financial officer Greg Smith and tasked with streamlining Boeing’s operation and improving productivity and supply chain health.The group will include “teams responsible” for functions such as manufacturing, supply chain operations, finance, corporate audit, strategy and administration.Boeing senior vice-president of manufacturing, supply chain and operations Jenette Ramos will take on a “special assignment in support” of Smith’s new group.“This new global organisation will embed operational excellence and consistent lean principles across Boeing and its supply chain, and restore production and supply chain health as Boeing and the broader aerospace industry recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Boeing says.The restructuring will also see Boeing combine its legal and compliance programmes, which include functions such as global trade controls, ethics and business conduct.Led by Boeing chief legal officer and executive vice-president of global compliance Brett Gerry, the new legal-compliance division will “help the company proactively address new legal and compliance obligations arising from an increasingly complex global regulatory environment”, Boeing says.As part of the changes, Boeing intends to name a new chief compliance officer, who will report to Gerry, chief executive David Calhoun and Boeing’s board audit committee.Boeing also says Diana Sands, senior vice-president of internal governance and administration, will retire “later this year”. She has worked at Boeing for nearly 20 years.Boeing says the changes will simplify its management, improve efficiency and make Boeing’s corporate infrastructure more cost effective. The company has not announced layoffs, and has disclosed no changes to its commercial aircraft division.The restructuring follows Calhoun’s announcement earlier this month that Boeing would need to transform to align with an industry changed by the coronavirus.“When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different. We will need to balance the supply and demand accordingly,” Calhoun said in a 2 April note to staff."
Business strategy change,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/19/groupons-evolving-business-model.aspx,Groupon's Evolving Business Strategy,"Groupon (GRPN -3.66%) is an online platform that helps people find deals on local restaurants, goods, and services. The company became a popular fad in 2010 as people flocked to get discounts as deep as 80% at local businesses. This translated into eye-popping growth for the young company leading to its 2011 IPO. However, revenue growth turned into revenue decline shortly after the IPO as competition emerged and Groupons popularity faded.After several years of declining revenue, Groupon is attempting to turnaround its business by moving away from the heavily discounted coupon vouchers that made it famous toward a less discount-driven user experience that encourages more habitual use. Groupon is also investing in partnerships to increase the number of deals available on its platform. Will these changes stem Groupons declining sales and keep the platform relevant?Moving away from discount vouchersIn an effort to improve its customer experience, Groupon is phasing out its voucher system. Historically, a Groupon user would pay for a deal up-front and then download a voucher that could be redeemed for a good or service. Recently, however, the company has introduced card-linked deals and booking requirements that allow for a more seamless user experience. By making Groupon easier to use, the company hopes that customers will use the platform more frequently.The company introduced card-linked deals in 2018. This new way to use Groupon requires customers to link a credit card to their Groupon account to get cash back after they buy a good or service advertised on the platform. The cash back amount varies from smaller discounts of 5% to 10% to deep discounts of 40%+. Unlike Groupons legacy voucher model, customers taking advantage of card-linked deals dont pay until the point of service and can use deals an unlimited number of times (as long as the deal is still active), but card-linked deals tend to carry smaller discounts than Groupon has typically featured.Groupon has also made changes to its legacy voucher-based coupon product by requiring booking appointments for certain coupon categories. Booking appointments is in lieu of using a coupon voucher, which aims to create a more natural interaction between customers and businesses.The bottom line is that Groupon has been tweaking its core products to enhance the customer experience and encourage more frequent use. Groupon is probably onto something because it has studied its customer behavior for years and has a good sense for what will improve the platform.Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Groupon.Investing in the health of the marketplaceGroupon takes a fee from the transactions that occur on its marketplace. For the company to be prosperous, it must maintain a healthy marketplace platform with a lot of transaction activity. There are two sides of a marketplace: buyers and sellers. Groupon has invested to ensure both sides of its marketplace find value on the platform.To increase the number of buyers on its platform, the company invested nearly $400 million on marketing last year. This marketing spend consisted of paid online advertising, such as search engine keywords, as well as offline advertising, such as TV commercials. The investment in marketing attracts people to use the platform, but maintaining an excellent user experience keeps people on the platform.In a new effort to increase the number of sellers, Groupon has forged partnerships with other marketplaces. For example, Groupon partners with GrubHub for restaurants, Viator for travel, and Live Nation for live event tickets. Groupon splits the fees it collects on transactions sourced from marketplace partners. Although fee-sharing makes these deals less profitable, Groupon is betting that the massive increase in available offerings will make the overall marketplace more worthwhile for consumers.A marketplace can be a fragile thing if it is not nurtured. If there are fewer people browsing for deals, the marketplace will be less lucrative for businesses. If there are fewer businesses on the platform, people will not find as many compelling deals. By making investments across both buyers and sellers, Groupon is enhancing the health of its marketplace, creating a better customer experience.Still a strong marketing platformOne thing that hasnt changed about Groupons story is that it still has tremendous reach for local businesses marketing their services. Aside from Google and Yelp, consumers do not have many options for discovering local businesses. That is probably why Groupons app has been downloaded over 195 million times and is consistently ranked highly in mobile app stores. Because of its popularity, local businesses likely will continue using the platform to find new customers.Groupon is adjusting its approach to both the end consumer and to businesses in order to enhance the customer experience and improve the health of its marketplace platform. Some of the changes, especially on the product side, are more experimental and may change again in the future. Other changes, such as adding marketplace partnerships, are long overdue and add a tremendous amount of value to Groupons platform.After years of disappointment, it is difficult to assess if Groupon will be able to turnaround and show revenue growth again. However, the new effort to improve the user experience and make bold bets on new products is a sign that the company is taking the challenge seriously."
Business strategy change,https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/subway-changes-its-franchising-strategy,Subway changes its franchising strategy,"Subway believes its new remodels will help lure bigger franchisees into the system./Photo courtesy of SubwaySubway, on what it calls a “multi-year transformational journey,” detailed a handful of steps on Thursday that it says will overhaul its U.S. development strategy.The biggest is targeting multi-unit franchise owners. The company said that it hopes to lure these operators into the system through potential acquisitions of existing restaurant portfolios. It believes that a new design, flexible footprint, brand awareness and low startup costs can help lure these operators into the system.“Historically, Subway has been a system of primarily single-restaurant operators,” Steve Rafferty, SVP of development for the Milford, Conn.-based company, said in a statement. “These operators, often first-time business owners and budding entrepreneurs, have always been integral to our growth strategy.“At the same time, to ensure we remain competitive for years to come, we’re scaling up with high-caliber multi-unit franchisees who bring operating expertise, development capabilities and capital.”But the company listed other strategies, including a remodel program that has already refreshed nearly 9,000 locations and a focus on growth that targets locations with drive-thrus or nontraditional locations. Subway has traditionally targeted lower-cost, inline locations for development. But the pandemic has intensified demand for convenience, which has increased the need for drive-thrus or similar points of access.Subway also says it is focusing on international growth. The company says it has signed eight master franchise deals and development agreements that could add 5,000 locations around the world in years to come.But it’s the focus on multi-unit franchisees that remains the more notable effort for the brand, whose average operator owns just two locations—most of which are low-volume restaurants. The typical Subway averages about $430,000 in revenues per year, according to data from Restaurant Business sister company Technomic.The brand’s struggles have led thousands of Subway locations to close. Since the brand peaked at about 27,000 domestic locations in 2014, about 6,000 locations have closed down, most of those in the past three years—including 1,000 last year. The brand has 21,000 U.S. locations and 37,000 globally.Subway believes larger-scale franchisees could have more wherewithal, which could enable them to fund remodel projects or expansion.One problem for the brand is its low unit volumes. While the company’s average unit sales grew 20% in 2021, according to Technomic, they remain 8% below where they were a decade ago.Subway says most of its units continue to generate sales growth and some franchisees we’ve spoken to back that up. The company says that 75% of the system, featuring more than 15,000 locations, were up an average of 8.2% over 2019 levels in the first three months of 2022.Members help make our journalism possible.

Business strategy change,https://hbr.org/2021/06/inside-ikeas-digital-transformation,Inside IKEA’s Digital Transformation,"How does going digital change a legacy retail brand? According to Barbara Martin Coppola, CDO at IKEA Retail, it’s a challenge of remaining fundamentally the same company while doing almost everything differently. In this Q&A, Martin Coppola talks about how working in tech for 20 years prepared her for this challenge, why giving customers control over their data is good business, and how to stay focused on the core mission when you’re changing everything else.What does it mean for one of the world’s most recognizable retail brands to go digital? For almost 80 years, IKEA has been in the very analogue business of selling its distinct brand of home goods to people. Three years ago, IKEA Retail (Ingka Group) hired Barbara Martin Coppola — a veteran of Google, Samsung, and Texas Instruments — to guide the company through a digital transformation and help it enter the next era of its history. HBR spoke with Martin Coppola about the particular challenge of transformation at a legacy company, how to sustain your culture when you’re changing almost everything, and how her 20 years in the tech industry prepared her for this task.How is the digital transformation at IKEA changing how the company actually operates in the day-to-day?In practical terms, we’ve approximately tripled ecommerce levels in three years. We have transformed our stores to also act as fulfilment centers. To make that work, the flow of goods needed to change, the supply mechanisms needed to change, and also the floorplans of the store needed to change. Ecommerce is open 24 hours a day, while traditional stores are not, which means we’ve needed to learn how to operate at two speeds, while operating from one space. Goods can be delivered from the stores, or from different distribution centers — and algorithms are helping figure out where the goods are being sourced from. We’re rapidly expanding data and analytics and changing how they’re embedded in decision making.With the pandemic and with the closure of approximately 75% of our stores, we ramped-up and accelerated even more as people turned online and towards digital solutions. Things that would normally take years or months were carried out within days and weeks.The digital transformation is not a goal in and of itself, and it is so much more than technology. We are transforming our business: We are exploring potential new offers to customers, new ways to bring our offers to customers, and new ways to operate our business. And in order to be successful, digital needs to be embedded in every aspect of IKEA. Digital is a way of working, making decisions, and managing the company.How would you describe what it is you’re trying to do through this process?To realize our mission, we need to stay relevant, and we need to evolve with the ever-changing needs of our customers.Now, this process is a bit like an iceberg. At the top of the iceberg, we have the customer needs and adaptation — revamping everything around customer interaction and new purchasing journeys — and under the surface we are making huge changes to our business and operating model. And what is under the surface is a much bigger change than what we see above.I’ll give you an example. We are revamping customer interactions both digitally and, in the store, and we’re connecting them. For instance, you might start planning your new kitchen by yourself at home on ikea.com, and then you come to the store or connect with a remote customer meeting point, and we should be able to meet you where you are. Another example is the “Shop & Go” feature in the IKEA app — available in a few countries — which allows you to use your own mobile device to scan, pay for items and skip the checkout line in the store. That requires a complete modernization and reengineering of all the tech landscape within IKEA. It also requires a different way of operating to fulfill the goods to be bought. It requires reengineering of the full value chain, which needs to be governed by data and become more flexible than before. The result is meant to be a seamless, consistent customer experience.These transformations are happening at many layers within the company, and they require a multi-year strategy and a clear North Star to follow.How has your strategy changed as you moved through this process? What did you think it was going to be like at the beginning, and what has surprised you and what has changed along the way?The scope of the strategy has increased significantly over time as the company realized that digital needs to be embedded into everything we do. Our first focus was on revamping all meetings with the customer, especially online with new and improved navigation and search function. We secured high growth for ecommerce which went from 7% of revenue to 31% in 3 years.Inventory management, logistics, fulfillment, and supply chain overall had to be modernized through data, which in turn brought in new ways of working and operating. For example, stores became fulfillment centers. We’re also embedding new skills and people who bring new agility.Substantively, what does digital transformation mean for a company like IKEA? How does it change the company’s DNA?The DNA of IKEA doesn’t change, and it’s important that it doesn’t. Operating model wise, it means we’re adding data, increasing speed, using analytics in all our decision-making. Also, the skills we’re using are changing. I recall when I started at IKEA, my boss, Jesper Brodin said, “We’re changing everything — almost.” To me, this means we’re changing how we do things, but the soul of the company stays the same.Can you elaborate a bit on how to make sure the vision for the company remains consistent, even as you’re enacting fundamental changes?We are reinventing IKEA for the future, no less than that. At the beginning, this meant we needed to ensure that the transformation kept the IKEA DNA intact — that is, the culture, the values and the vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people. The question then became; how do we express these in the digital environment? And this led to the notion of human-centric technology. How to embed ethical behavior, respect diversity, how to treat people fairly — without bias — through technology. This means that we are focusing more on what we should do with data, rather than what we could do with data.IKEA has been gaining consumer trust for 78 years by having the unique opportunity and privilege to be invited to people’s home. This means we have built a lot of trust. And we want that same level of trust, if not higher, in the digital world. We know that data in the digital world is not being treated with the level of respect people require, and we are working on a new way that puts people and their privacy at the core.So, we’re taking a new approach. Our starting point was asking ourselves the most fundamental question: How do people react when they have more control over their own data, specifically on how and when they interact with a company? Our first step to tackle this was the Customer Data Promise, our commitment to putting people first in all data-driven processes. We want to provide customers with understanding, control, and the ability to make decisions about their data, so we added a functionality that lets consumers edit their data in the app at any given time. They see a centralized data control panel in the app, where they can change and personalize their inspirational feed and get contextual access to their data settings.And what we have seen thus far is that first, the data we are capturing is more relevant. When people decide what data they share with you, what you get is more relevant to their needs. Second, that there is more trust, therefore more engagement, and people are coming back and interacting with us more.How does your experience at a place like Google shape how you think about a task like this digital transformation at IKEA?I’ve worked in the technology industry for over 20 years for many innovative companies. And during that time, every single experience has given me learnings that I’m applying to IKEA’s transformation today.If I think about Google specifically, I’d say that speed, agility, and a strong customer focus, are important learnings I took with me. So, when you think about how to create products in the unknown, it’s really about fast iterations, learning through those iterations, and giving consumers the chance to gift it back, so, little by little, we build the product together with customers.Another learning from Google is that people are the most important asset a company has. You need to take care of people, and make sure that the right skills are present. This is what attracted me to IKEA, people here always come first, and they are the number one priority for the business. Recently we’ve been hiring for skills we didn’t have, as well as reskilling a lot of people so that together, we can become a high-performing team, caring for people’s wellbeing whilst continuously learning and growing.And the last thing I learned, I would say, is purpose. At Google, I was going to work with the deep belief that I was making people’s lives better — at that time we were revolutionizing how technology could help people. And I have that same feeling at IKEA. This has helped us a lot when going through our transformation. We know there will be challenging times, but we also know there is something bigger than our own reality, it helps us put energy and heart into creating an IKEA for generations to come.Culture plays a huge role in how successful digital transformations are, right? How much of being a successful CDO is addressing cultural and human issues?Transformations are about moving large numbers of people, not just a few people who have the necessary digital skills. That’s why culture is so important.Coming in at a top executive level, I had to first become accepted as part of the community. IKEA originates from the south of Sweden. The company values are about hard work, humbleness, being down to earth, and a strong entrepreneurial spirit — people want to go the extra mile for the company. I had to show through my behavior that I share the same values. Then, it was about meeting people and communicating an inspiring vision. Finally, it was about putting forward simple steps that people can see themselves following.Another part of leadership in transformation is having an open mind and believing that many things are possible, as well as knowing the importance of people and bringing them along in that journey with you. I always say to people “We’re going to do this and succeed at it,” which is not unrealistic, but rather a push to the teams to know that they can achieve the goals they set out to accomplish. And it’s important to bring your whole self to work, including the vulnerable side, especially during the pandemic. Saying “I’m human, I’m having a hard time right now,” allows other people to be vulnerable too. Giving people the permission to be human doesn’t make you less effective, in fact I see it as an important step to building trust.How do AR and VR feature in your plans for IKEA’s future?They are important new technologies that we need to test and try. We’ve been testing VR in the store, to visualize how a piece of furniture fits in a room. We recently acquired a California company by the name of Geomagical Labs. With their new AI technology, we will bring home visualization to a different level. By letting you scan your home, one room at a time, and turn it into a 3D model in which you can try out the IKEA home product range from any location. It’s a tool for democratizing home design, and that means it must be accessible to everyone. You will be able to access it via any smartphone — iPhone or Android; it needs to be simple enough for people to use it.As a leader, how do you think about using new technologies to support rather than replace workers?To automate or digitize IKEA, it may sound at times like we’re moving away from the humanity of it all, but in fact it’s the other way around. We are enabling people to do more of what they love, to learn and try new and different jobs that weren’t possible before. We want to relieve people of repetitive tasks, so a lot of our work right now consists of reskilling and helping people carry out a variety of roles.The pandemic, of course, changed and accelerated everyone’s plans regarding projects like these. But what has your experience been, and what have you learned from it?There’s been a lot of learning throughout this process. And many challenges remain. But the key is resilience, it’s never quitting. Giving the organization the strength to solve any problem. The resilience we have built so far is why we are where we are now, in a position of strength, always looking to grow and improve.Editor’s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
Business strategy change,https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-sonys-new-business-strategy-2015-2,Here's Sony's new business strategy,"Sony revealed a new business strategy that is ambitiously targeting an operating profit of at least $4.3 billion in the companys 2017 fiscal year (ending March 31st 2018).This is a huge leap from the ¥20bn operating profit predicted for the current year, ending March 31st. Indeed, the company still expects to register its sixth net loss in seven years during the present period, albeit by a smaller amount than it previously anticipated. Sony said it will use a goal of 10% return on equity (ROE) as the main indicator by which it will measure its profit target.Fewer productsChinese sales staff talk with customers behind a row of Sony computers for sale at a computer market in Beijing June 29, 2009. David Gray/ReutersThe Japanese electronics firm believes the key to swelling its profit and ROE base is to focus on a narrower band of products. Primarily, Sony has said it will no longer look to pursue growth in business areas where intense competition puts it at a disadvantage. Smartphones are one such example, and the company has struggled to compete with Samsung and Apple, as well as budget smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi.Although Sony will still make smartphones and TVs, it will not ""rule out considering an exit strategy"" in these areas. A possible spinoff or partnership for these divisions seems likely. The strategy will therefore see Sony shift to more profitable business areas, such as camera sensors, videogames and entertainment products.Three businessesA man walks in front of Sony Corps headquarters in Tokyo January 22, 2009. Toru Hanai/ReutersSonys CEO, Kazuo Hirai, has divided up the company into three sectors. The potentially profitable business areas have been categorised as the companys ""Growth Drivers"". This covers Devices, Game & Network Services, Pictures, and Music. Sony will employ aggressive capital investment in these areas, with the aim of achieving sales growth and profit expansion. There will be increased investment in image sensors, as well as enhanced R&D in the area, expanding their applications in everything from smartphones to medical treatment.Meanwhile, Sony will work to expand the installed user base of the PlayStation platform. In Pictures, Sony will focus on increasing its audience, and for Music it will centre growth on burgeoning areas such as the streaming music market.Next comes the ""Stable Profit Generators"" sector. Here, Sony will prioritise the generation of steady profit and positive cash flow for Imaging Products & Solutions, and Video & Sound. By capitalising on its existing technological expertise in these areas (rather than engaging in large-scale investment), and by optimising fixed costs and enhancing inventory control, Sony will target a profit maximisation and return on investment.Lastly, the laggards are those areas focusing on ""Volatility Management""; namely TV and Mobile Communications. These businesses operate in markets characterised by high volatility and challenging competitive landscapes. By carefully selecting the territories and product areas it targets, Sony will seek to limit its capital investment and establish a business structure capable of securing stable profits. To achieve stability, the company is aiming to spin off its Video and Sound business unit in October 2015, establishing it as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Sony says it will also explore potential alliances with other companies.An achievable goal?Kazuo Hirai AP Photo/Shizuo KambayashiSonys optimistic profit target belies the tumult that the company has suffered in recent years. Indeed, even now it is still restructuring, selling off its PC division and spinning off its TV business, as well as cutting thousands of jobs. However, many in the technology industry have praised Sonys trajectory over the past year, which has seen its share value increase by over 80%. This growth has been partly attributed both to the recent appointment of Kazuo Hirai to company CEO, and to the appointment of Kenichiro Yoshida as his Chief Strategy Officer in late 2013.As this announcement suggests, the pair are likely to continue to aggressively pursue restructuring over the short to medium term. During Mr Hirais recent strategy presentation, he placed particular emphasis on profitability over volume, securing business unit autonomy with a focus on shareholder value and providing a clearer definition of each business units position within Sonys overall business.Click here to subscribe to The Economist."
Business strategy change,https://www.strategy-business.com/article/07306,"Rebuilding Lego, Brick by Brick","Lego art by Sean KenneyPhotographs by Matthew SeptimusOn the surface, the Lego Group didn’t look as if it was in trouble. The fourth-largest toymaker in the world at the time (today it is fifth-largest), the Lego Group sold €1 billion (US$1.35 billion) worth of toys in 2004, ranging from its snap-together bricks for young children to Mindstorms, a line of do-it-yourself robot kits for older kids. Even in the digital age, its toys maintained a surprisingly firm grip on the market and seemed to adapt well to changing tastes. The company’s steady stream of new products routinely generated three-quarters of its yearly sales. Popular enthusiasm was so great that in 2000, the British Association of Toy Retailers joined Fortune magazine in naming the company’s classic bricks “the toy of the century.”But the Lego Group’s financial performance told another story. Despite its extraordinary hold on the imagination of children around the world, the Billund, Denmark, company was in trouble. The Lego Group had lost money four out of the seven years from 1998 through 2004. Sales dropped 30 percent in 2003 and 10 percent more in 2004, when profit margins stood at –30 percent. Lego Group executives estimated that the company was destroying €250,000 ($337,000) in value every day.How could such a seemingly successful toymaker lose that much money? Some observers speculated that the Lego Group had overdiversified its product line with moves into such areas as apparel and theme parks. Others blamed the exploding popularity of video games or pressure from low-cost producers in China.Although there was some truth in these hypotheses, many other factors impeded the success of the iconic global brand, including its innovation capabilities and its supply chain. The company leadership knew it had to address those problems, and that the supply chain posed the most immediate opportunity for improvement. The Lego Group’s supply chain was at least 10 years out of date. Poor customer service and spotty availability of products were eroding the com­pany’s franchise in key markets. Speedy attention to the supply chain, the leaders reasoned, would not only buy them time to deal with the other challenges, but could help set in motion a virtuous circle of improvements that would support subsequent changes in the rest of the company.And it would address head-on one of the company’s most pressing challenges. Having established itself in an era when supply chain management was a matter of moving boxes from here to there, the Lego Group had missed a sea change as retail giants like Wal-Mart and Carrefour gained dominance. The company’s supply chain was geared for custom delivery to the smaller retailers that had owned the toy market in the 1950s when its bricks first became popular. For nearly six decades, this way of doing business had served the company very well — and then the system started to fail. In the 1990s, as competitors focused on regearing for the big-box stores, the Lego Group considered its primary challenge to be brand building — despite the fact that its bricks were already among the most recognized toys in the world. By the end of that decade, most of the Lego Group had lost ground to companies that operated with much greater sophistication, companies that analyzed and optimized every cost driver to provide just-in-time service to the behemoths. (U.S. operations were a notable exception to this problem.)To rebuild profitability, the company had to refashion every aspect of its supply chain. That meant eliminating inefficiencies, aligning its innovation capacity with the market, and re-gearing to compete in the new big-box world. This was no small matter for the Lego Group, which by the time CEO Jorgen Vig Knudstorp took the helm in 2004, had grown to roughly 7,300 employees, working mostly in two factories and three packaging centers — each in a different country — turning out more than 10,000 permutations of its products packaged in hundreds of configurations.The company’s leadership team recognized that even though transformation would be painful, it was imperative. “From my perspective, the supply chain is a company’s circulation system,” says Knudstorp. “You have to fix it to keep the blood flowing.”Diagnosing the ProblemThe symptoms of a dangerously misaligned supply chain can be deceptive. At the Lego Group, for instance, it took many years of underperformance before the company realized that the supply chain was a major source of its difficulties. What made those problems especially hard to identify was that they grew out of the company’s core strengths: its capacity for innovation and its commitment to quality. Those were the very advantages that the company’s leaders had relied on at first to reverse the profitless streak, hoping the company could innovate its way out of trouble. From the mid-1990s through 2004, the Lego Group moved into video games, TV programs, and retail stores. But the diversification added layers of complexity, and the red ink continued to flow.In 2004, the family that had founded and run the Lego Group knew they had to change direction. The then CEO Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the carpenter who had launched the company in 1932 and created the first snap-together Lego bricks in 1949, convened the leadership team to chart a new course. The measures they considered were radical, and to execute them, the Kristiansen family turned to an outsider. Kristiansen had been CEO for 25 years when he stepped aside in October 2004 for Knudstorp, then 34, a onetime management consultant who had joined the company in 2001 as a director of strategic development.With the mandate for change clear, Knudstorp spent his first weeks as CEO working closely with Kristiansen and the other members of the board and the leadership team to pinpoint the source of the company’s problems. Was the Lego Group too diversified? Yes, but focus alone was unlikely to be the silver bullet. Were costs an issue? Absolutely, but they were just one aspect of an array of challenges, including service, so a stand-alone cost play was unlikely to succeed. Had the company lost touch with the video game–obsessed consumer market? That hypothesis withered in the face of a simple fact: Three-quarters of the Lego Group’s sales every year were from new, mostly nonelectronic products. “I believe that the focus on electronic competition was really a blame game,” Knudstorp says.Instead, as Knudstorp and his team examined every facet of the company’s operations, they came to focus on the supply chain. They approached it holistically, analyzing every aspect of the company’s product development, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution.Product Development. Given the success of the Lego Group’s steady stream of innovative new offerings over the years, the “Kitchen,” the company’s product development lab, was a point of corporate pride. But the leadership team found that new products were delivering less and less profit. Each successive generation of offerings added more complexity. Plastic bricks and other elements that were once available only in primary colors, plus black and white, now came in more than 100 hues. A far cry from the simple box of bricks that baby boomers grew up with, Lego sets had grown much more elaborate: A pirate kit included eight pirates with 10 types of legs in different attire and positions.Such intricacy and attention to detail reflected the firm’s culture of craftsmanship, but also its disregard for the costs of innovation. The company designers were dreaming up new toys without factoring in the price of materials or the costs of production. That kind of carefree creativity is unsustainable in the current global toy market, where cost pressures are a constant concern.Furthermore, introducing new products every year is not necessarily a bad thing, but the Lego Group did not align its supply chain with that business strategy. Just 30 products generated 80 percent of sales, while two-thirds of the company’s 1,500-plus stock keeping units (SKUs) were items that it no longer manufactured. And the number of SKUs multiplied every year, increasing that backlog.Sourcing. The Lego Group dealt with an astonishing array of suppliers, more than 11,000 in all. That’s nearly twice as many suppliers as Boeing uses to build its airplanes. The numbers had crept up gradually over the years, as product developers sought new materials. Each engineer had his or her own favorite vendors, and the company’s lack of procurement compliance procedures allowed the engineers to form ad hoc relationships with suppliers — a practice that grew more problematic as the group expanded into new businesses.These sourcing practices led to incredible waste. A new design might call for a unique material, such as a specially colored resin, that sold in three-ton lots. It might take just a few kilos of the substance to produce the new toy, but the company would be stuck with €10,000 ($13,500) worth of resin it would never need. Ordering so many specialized products at irregular intervals from a large number of vendors left the Lego Group’s procurement staff powerless to leverage the company’s scale in dealing with suppliers.Manufacturing. As was the case with sourcing, the Lego Group gained limited advantage from its scale in the way it organized its production facilities. The company ran one of the largest injection-molding operations in the world, with more than 800 machines, in its Danish factory, yet the production teams operated as hundreds of independent toy shops. The teams placed their orders haphazardly and changed them frequently, preventing operations from piecing together a reliable picture of demand needs, supply capabilities, and inventory levels. This murkiness led to overall capacity utilization of just 70 percent.In such a fragmented system, long-term planning can be exceptionally difficult. Day-to-day operations were often chaotic. Operators routinely responded to last-minute demands, readily implementing costly changeovers. That the Lego Group’s production sites were located in such high-cost countries as Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States put the company at a further disadvantage.Distribution. The Lego Group paid as much attention to the thousands of stores that together generated only one-third of its revenue as it did the 200 larger chains that accounted for the other two-thirds. Without clearly defined service policies, the company spent a disproportionate amount of time and effort serving small shops, which drove up the costs of fulfillment substantially. Sixty-seven percent of all orders consisted of less than a full carton — an incredibly costly proposition that demands labor-intensive “pick-packing” at the distribution center. In addition, to serve its many small customers, the Lego Group had developed a multiple-tier inventory system with local centers; it was very difficult to position the right product in the right distribution center, a challenge that contributed to missed sales and high inventory levels.Making Change ClickTo drive the transformation, Knudstorp gathered a diverse group of senior executives and managers to take a two-track approach. The leadership team developed the strategy, while the larger group of planners and representatives from sales, logistics, IT, and manufacturing coordinated change at the operational level.The leadership set up a war room where the operational team gathered every day to work out such nitty-gritty decisions as what toys to make, how tasks should be prioritized, and how to deal with obstacles. Team members tracked the progress of key initiatives, resolved bottlenecks as they arose, and settled a variety of issues. Assigning clear responsibility in this way avoided the all-too-human tendency in organizations to point fingers rather than solve problems.The team drew up hundreds of lists tracking backlogged items, delivery glitches, and inventory levels, among other concerns, on white boards around the room, and at any given time over the next year, 30 to 40 people gathered to hash out plans. Knudstorp would often visit the war room, quizzing managers when he saw that an item had not been resolved since his last visit. “This is still here?” he would ask. The magnitude of the work was so daunting and the pressure to finish by year’s end so intense that at one point someone joked that everything would work out just fine, provided they move Christmas to the second week of January.Despite the urgency, executives paid real attention to detail. They took care to set clear priorities, limit the scope of individual projects, and monitor progress closely. Each team worked out its cross-functional plans through lengthy workshops. The process started with an examination of one aspect of the company’s supply chain complexity and an analysis of its impact on productivity, planning, and control. These analytics were particularly useful in framing the case for transformation in the face of expected resistance. Using a hypothesis-driven approach, the team would debate how to change and improve processes. Once they’d agreed on a plan of attack, the teams would change direction only if the original hypothesis proved faulty — a tactic that team members say kept the whole process on track.The leadership team also allotted time to consensus building. They knew that management by decree would never work well in a close-knit, family-owned company. The executives understood that, for the initiatives to stand any chance of success, the Lego Group needed to preserve the loyalty of its workforce, even as the move to a more global supply chain did away with many jobs. The most respectful way to navigate through this transition, they reasoned, was to adopt a strategy of complete transparency. The team shared and debated the realities of the situation with the total workforce early in the process and consulted with them throughout in putting together the painful plans to address redundancy. (The Lego Group has also moved its U.S. plants to Mexico in search of labor cost savings and market proximity.) Yet as slow-footed as that process sometimes seemed at the time, working through it had an important benefit: When the teams finally reached a consensus, the decision stuck.In tandem with the planning and consultative processes, the leadership ordered a pilot program designed to make sourcing more strategic. At its helm they placed Chief Financial Officer Jesper Ovesen — a clear signal that this initiative was of the utmost importance. Ovesen’s team believed that rationalizing the cost of the company’s materials would be one of the easier parts of the transformation and would yield savings immediately. Not coincidentally, the initiative went right to the heart of the Lego Group’s innovation capability: the resins that gave the bricks their distinctive colors. If it succeeded, the pilot would do more than save money. It would demonstrate that the Lego Group really could change.The price of colored resins, always a major expenditure for the company, was highly volatile. The sourcing team analyzed the prices of the raw materials and worked with a narrowed roster of suppliers to stabilize pricing. The resulting contracts made production much easier to plan. More importantly, the success of the sourcing project created a sense of optimism and the momentum to move ahead with other changes. At each cost center along the supply chain, the transition team applied its new insight: Constraints don’t destroy creativity or product excellence, and they can even enhance them.Indeed, the idea of implementing new constraints could now help the company build on its established strengths. The Lego Group motto is “Only the best is good enough,” and the company name derives from the Danish words Leg godt, meaning “play well.” The drive to innovate was deeply embedded in the corporate culture. In the early years, this idea had helped the com­pany develop its brand and instill pride in its employees. But after a time, it had come to be seen as a mandate to create new toys at any cost. In Knudstorp’s view, the perceived mandate had evolved into a crutch. “This idea had become an emotional concept and an excuse to oppose new cost-saving initiatives,” he says. “Anytime there was something someone didn’t want to do, they would say, ‘You cannot do that because of quality.’”But Mads Nipper, the company’s chief of product innovation, worked closely with Bali Padda, who oversees the supply chain, to devise a series of day-to-day solutions to the paradox of constraints. Nipper and Padda recommended slicing the palette of roughly 100 colors in half. They also recommended cutting back on the thousands of different police officers, pirates, and other figures in production. The team took a deliberate approach, building on the resin-sourcing work to analyze the true costs of each element and identify those whose costs were out of line with the rest of the stock. This initiative, coupled with the resin pilot, helped the Lego Group cut its resin costs in half and shrink its supplier roster by 80 percent.At the same time, the operational team put a process in place to help designers make more cost-effective choices. Team members devised basic rules regarding the creation of new colors and shapes and spelled out the requirements for ordering new materials. They also created a cost matrix, clearly showing the price associated with each change. Once the costs of innovation were clear, designers were urged to use existing elements in new ways, rather than devise new elements requiring new molds and colors. The initiative encouraged the designers to think in terms of price trade-offs when they were developing a new item: Yes, you can give sparkling amber eyes to your new Bionicle space alien action figure, but it may limit your choices on its claws.Cost transparency gave developers a new way to define their achievement. “The best cooks are not the ones who have all the ingredients in front of them. They’re the ones who go into whatever kitchen and work with whatever they have,” wrote a senior manager in a memo to the Lego Group’s own Kitchen. The designers seemed to take those words to heart. The product development group “initially saw reducing complexity as pure pain,” says Knudstorp, “but gradually they realized that what they had seen at first as a new set of constraints could in fact enable them to become even more creative.”The evolution of the design team’s thinking re­affirmed for Knudstorp an idea he has long held about the importance of looking at business issues holistically. “I think one of the big mistakes companies often make in this kind of initiative is approaching the supply chain as one topic, innovation as another, product quality as a third. The better way to think about it is that all these issues are connected,” he says. “Innovation is also a supply chain issue, and sometimes the supply chain can provide ideas for consumer- or customer-driven innovation.”Approaching the Value Chain HolisticallyCutting the number of elements and colors in production made it easier to take the next step — rationalizing production cycles. The team started by halting the time-honored practice of making every machine available to produce any element, an approach that necessitated constant, costly retooling. Instead, the team assigned specific molds to specific machines, and set up regular four- to 12-week production cycles. The group then deemed that sales and operations would set orders at a regular monthly meeting, reducing the need for constant changeovers.The leadership team also clarified decision rights to ensure that schedules made sense for the enterprise as a whole. For instance, it would no longer be acceptable to make manual changes in a molding machine without informing the finished-goods packing team, an important consideration since different kits are packaged in different boxes. Clearer descriptions of rights and responsibilities made it more difficult to dodge tough decisions, or to make them without considering their impact on other departments. As a result, the company was able to sidestep many potential production glitches.The team also considered the manufacturing footprint. The Lego Group had already outsourced 10 percent of its production to Chinese contract manufacturers, but the team decided against sending more work to Asia. Instead, building on its successful experience moving some production to Kladno, Czech Republic, the company concluded that it could actually boost efficiency by locating its factories near its most important markets. A plant in Eastern Europe would get products to European store shelves in three to four days — an important consideration given that Europe accounts for 60 percent of the company’s sales and that 40 percent of sales take place during the Christmas season.In 2005, the Lego Group began outsourcing the manufacture of its simpler products to a Hungarian facility belonging to Flextronics, a Singapore-based electronics manufacturer. That year the company also expanded its operations in Kladno. Arriving at this point, however, was difficult in two ways: The negotiations were long and difficult, and the impact on the company’s workforce had to be managed with great care. Chief Purchasing Officer Niels Duedahl was tasked with overseeing the process, supported by a team of analysts who built detailed cost models. Their philosophy was to understand their suppliers’ costs better than the suppliers themselves did. This approach would enable the Lego Group’s leaders not just to evaluate the options but also to approach subcontractor proposals armed for negotiation.The Lego Group also needed to move its distribution channels closer to the customer — and to lower its bloated distribution costs. First, the number of its logistics providers was cut from 26 to three or four — enough to ensure resilience and gain greater economies of scale while still encouraging competition among the suppliers. This step alone saved more than 10 percent in transportation costs. But consolidating logistics providers really just brought the Lego Group in line with what many of its competitors had done years ago. However, the company was able to leapfrog the competition by redesigning its entire distribution system.Although many companies have taken manufacturing to lower-cost markets and to contract providers, surprisingly few have done the same with distribution, although identical advantages exist. The Lego Group phased out five centers in Denmark, Germany, and France and created a single new center in the Czech Republic, to be operated by DHL. “Putting all your eggs in one basket” might sound like a poor strategy to reduce risk, but consolidated distribution made inventory easier to track and made stock shortages far less likely. It also brought the Lego Group closer to Europe’s largest population centers, decreasing the average distance to market.With a new value chain in place, the Lego Group could act with the understanding that customers had differentiated needs. The company’s marketing team followed the examples of other consumer packaged-goods manufacturers, working more closely with the largest retailers to conduct joint forecasting, inventory management, and product customization. Those big-box and chain stores that made up the bulk of the Lego Group’s market would receive marketing support as well. The company would continue to deal with smaller sellers, but on more regular and standardized terms. The company further minimized the cost of serving each account by providing discounts for early orders and refusing to ship less-than-full cartons.The largest Lego Group customers were also in­vited to participate in product development. Not only would this presumably make the big clients happier, but the retailers’ strong forecasting and replenishment technol­ogy would give the company marketers access to a greater level of insight into buyer behavior than the company had on its own. The Lego Group would also let these large retailers help make assortment decisions, and sweeten the relationship further by providing some SKUs on an exclusive basis.Profitable Once MoreThanks in part to its supply chain transformation, the Lego Group is profitable once more. It has saved approximately €50 million ($67 million) since 2004, and forecasts savings in excess of €100 million ($135 million) over the next two years. The tremendous gains in efficiency meant that despite the impact of rising oil prices on materials and transportation, stock turnover increased by 12 percent in 2005, and the same year, the Lego Group recorded its first profits — €61 million ($72 million) — since 2002. This positive trend further continued in 2006, with the Lego Group turnover up by 11 percent over 2005, and profits up by a staggering 240 percent. The Lego Group supply chain is now so advanced that the company is actually “slightly getting ahead of the competition in some parameters,” says Knudstorp.The gains are more than operational. Knudstorp argues that the supply chain restructuring has had a transformational impact on the company as a whole. Getting the right product to the right place at the right time at the right cost was an important early step in grappling with an array of strategic challenges. “It has allowed us to again focus on developing the business, on innovation, and on developing our organization to become a much more creative place to work,” says Knudstorp. “Those are luxuries we didn’t have when we didn’t make money and we had a supply chain that was 10 to 15 years behind the times.” Now that the Lego Group has rationalized and streamlined its product development, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, it can pour its resources into what it does best: making wonderful toys.Reprint No. 07306Author Profiles:Keith Oliver (oliver_keith@bah.com) is a senior vice president in Booz Allen Hamilton’s London office.

Business strategy change,https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/12484-mondelezs-new-strategy-emphasizes-local-control-faster-innovation,"Mondelez’s new strategy emphasizes local control, faster innovation","DEERFIELD, ILL. — It was only six years ago when Kraft Foods spun off Mondelez International to create one of the largest snack-centric companies in the world. Since that time, management’s focus has been on growing the company’s “power brands,” those within the company’s portfolio that represent approximately three-quarters of net revenues, and margin management. Under new chairman and chief executive officer Dirk Van de Put, that’s about to change.Mr. Van de Put spoke Sept. 7 during Mondelez’s investor day. He emphasized that while the company’s large brands and an efficient infrastructure remain important to the company, he said Mondelez must adapt to a changing marketplace. A strategic priority for management is “consumer-centric growth."".“We have a wide range of brands,” Mr. Van de Put said. “Fine-tuning the role these brands play in our portfolio offers major opportunity. At the same time, the consumer snacking behavior is complex and changing. We need to be fully attuned to where consumers are, where they shop, what they buy, when they buy and why they snack.”Mondelez has developed a proprietary snacking database based on interviews with an estimated 170,000 consumers, said Mr. Van de Put. The database allows the company to evaluate how consumers snack across different emotional or functional needs and occasions.“With this new methodology, we are able to segment snacking needs based on all possible drivers like state of hunger, time of the day, location, emotional need, demographics and so on,” he said. “All this allows us to sharpen our brand positioning, improve our communication, ensure our portfolio remains incremental and avoid overlap, and it also identifies innovation and renovation opportunities. All of this is leading to a better consumer connection with increased sales and higher returns on our marketing and innovation investments.”Most consumers know Mondelez by its stable of large brands like Oreo, Ritz, Milka, Lu and others. Mr. Van de Put said those brands remain important to the company’s future, but he has made a priority of unlocking some of Mondelez’s lesser-known local brands. As an example, he referenced Mondelez’s Opavia biscuit brand in the Czech Republic.“It is the leader in the biscuit market, with a strong heritage, a very emotional connection with local consumers and a very broad portfolio,” he said. “We recently reinvested in the brand, differentiated it more from competition, and we improved its in-store visibility. As a result, Opavia went from mid-single-digit declines to low single-digit growth. We have many Opavia-like situations around the world, and we see growing evidence that this strategy will accelerate our overall sales.”Other local brands that may receive additional investment include Triscuit, The Natural Confectionery Co., Cote D’or and Kinh Do.The company’s “local” focus also will include the empowerment of sales and marketing teams on the ground in specific markets. Currently, 15 markets around the world account for 79% of Mondelez’s revenue. Mr. Van de Put said that while the company already has a strong presence in those markets, its usually in one or two categories.“This means we have a tremendous opportunity to use our local strength in one category to boost our growth in the others,” he said. “As an example, we see key growth opportunities in biscuits, for instance, in India and Australia; and in chocolate, in Mexico and Southeast Asia. We will also empower our local teams to move faster, launch more relevant local innovations and hold them accountable for accelerated growth.”Mondelez’s innovation process will evolve as well, focusing on expanding such brands as Oreo into new categories, for example. New Oreo formats and applications include bites, rolls and thins as well as chocolate, ice cream, yogurt and brownies, according to Mr. Van de Put.“We are also changing our innovation approach, switching to fast test and learn and then scale fast versus an immediate big launch,” he said. “This will lead to more projects coming to market faster. We also, of course, have to invest in the development of new skills and capabilities of our teams.”While past operational programs at Mondelez were focused on improving efficiencies, Mr. Van de Put said the company will emphasize return on investment and growth in the future.""We are fundamentally changing our ways of working to provoke a shift in mindset and behaviors."" — Dirk Van de Put, Mondelez“…In order to make our growth-driven strategy a success, we are fundamentally changing our ways of working to provoke a shift in mindset and behaviors,” he said. “The newer area of operational improvement is digitalization. It includes, of course, optimization of our supply chain operations, achieving omni-channel excellence or delivering consumer-centric digital marketing. For example, on the consumer-facing side, we are increasing our use of new technology such as social listening and advanced analytics to better understand the consumers needs and react faster on emerging needs. As an example, in our supply chain operations side, we will boost the use of advanced automation, artificial intelligence and 3D printing to reduce our time to market, reduce our costs or personalize our products.”In fiscal 2017, Mondelez International generated $25,896 million in sales and earnings of $2,922 million, equal to $41.93 per share on the common stock. Mr. Van de Put said the strategic changes the company is making will accelerate future sales growth to 3%-plus per year, and it will enable high single-digit earnings per share growth.“This is clearly a shift in our value-creation model,” he said. “For the past five years, our cost focus has lifted the company to the next level. We can now build on this and drive a more sustainable, higher-quality earnings growth approach.”"
Business strategy change,https://www.powermag.com/siemens-combining-business-units-as-part-of-new-strategy/,Siemens Combining Business Units as Part of New Strategy,"Siemens reported a 2% rise in industrial profit for its fiscal third quarter on August 2, topping analyst forecasts, though the German engineering giant also reported that revenue for the quarter dropped 4%. The earnings report comes as the company prepares to implement a new strategy that cuts its number of business divisions.The company announced management changes ahead of the October 1 start of its Vision 2020+ plan, which replaces the company’s Vision 2020 outline adopted in 2014. Under the new plan, whose beginning coincides with the start of the company’s next fiscal year and is scheduled to be in place by the end of March 2019, Siemens’ five industrial divisions will be combined into three operating companies.The company said the three operating entities—Gas and Power, Smart Infrastructure, and Digital Industries—will give its individual businesses “more entrepreneurial freedom.” The new units will work with what Siemens calls its Strategic Companies, which include Siemens Gamesa, Siemens Healthineers, and the planned Siemens Alstom train unit.Management changes also are in the offing. Roland Busch, the company’s chief technology officer, will take the role of chief operating officer, with analysts saying the move could mean Busch would replace Joe Kaeser as chief executive officer if Kaeser steps down as planned in 2021.Lisa Davis, who has been leading the underperforming power and gas division, has been tapped to lead the new Gas and Power unit. Davis’ group reported a 56% decline in profit during the fiscal third quarter (April-June), which Siemens said resulted from “ongoing adverse markets” as its customers move away from fossil fuel-powered generation to renewable energy. Siemens said it sold only five large gas turbines in the quarter and warned of further market declines.Reports in June of this year said Siemens might consider selling its turbine unit. The company at the time said it would not comment on market speculation.Kaeser in a statement about the new business strategy said, “It would be irresponsible to rest on our laurels now. The speed and power of global changes are increasing, and it’s our obligation to anticipate them. Were convinced that this is the right time to sustainably shape our future.”Siemens said the changes would make the company “leaner” but there were no details about potential job cuts. The company in November 2017 said it would cut 6,900 jobs as it consolidates its power divisions.The company in its earnings report said industrial profit rose 2% to $2.6 billion from April through June, while revenue dropped 4% to $23.7 billion, below analyst expectations of $24 billion. Kaeser in a statement characterized the earnings report as “a strong quarter.”Siemens said its restructuring also includes increased investment in the Internet of Things, along with electric mobility and digitization. The company on August 1 said it is buying Mendix, a Boston, Massachusetts-based industrial software company, for $700 million. Siemens in its earnings report said its Digital Factory automation unit continues to deliver the fastest profit increase of all the company’s industrial businesses, increasing profit by 54% in the third quarter with strong revenue growth in the U.S. and China.Siemens said it expects paring its number of business units will increase the company’s annual growth rate and profit margin for its industrial business by 2% over what it called the “medium term,” or the next three to five years.—Darrell Proctor is a POWER associate editor (@DarrellProctor1, @POWERmagazine)."
Business strategy change,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/bob-chapek-2022-memo-storytelling-1235072324/,Bob Chapek’s Memo to Staff: Disney Has Three “Strategic Pillars” Moving Forward,"Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek outlined three “strategic pillars” for the company going forward in a memo to staff Monday. Chapek’s memo comes as Disney prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2023.“I believe our mission for this year is clear: set the stage for our second century, and ensure Disney’s next 100 years are as successful as our first,” Chapek wrote in the memo, before outlining the “pillars.”The first pillar is “storytelling excellence,” which Chapek called the “Disney Magic” in his memo. Storytelling and creative was Bob Iger’s focus after he stepped down as CEO in 2020, and Chapek’s memo makes it clear that he intends to be engaged in the process.“To that end — and in addition to all my other creative meetings — I am establishing a new standing monthly meeting with our senior creative leaders to discuss the opportunities we face as a storytelling enterprise,” Chapek wrote. “This will encourage collaboration, sharing of best practices, and stimulate cross-studio ideation.”Iger officially left the company at the end of 2021, with Chapek writing Monday that he was “enormously grateful for the tremendous foundation Bob Iger left us.”The second pillar is “innovation,” which Chapek writes should leverage the company’s “franchise ecosystem.”“Since Steamboat Willie, we have been the world’s foremost innovative storytellers,” Chapek wrote. “That must continue as technology evolves, giving our creative teams new canvases like the metaverse on which to paint.”The final pillar is a “relentless focus on our audience,” and placing consumers as the company’s “North Star.” Disney’s evolving theatrical and streaming strategy appears to play a critical role in that area (most recently, the company revealed that Pixar’s Turning Red will go direct to Disney+)“Right now, their behavior tells us and our industry that the way they want to experience entertainment is changing — and changing fast thanks to technology and the pandemic,” Chapek writes. “We must evolve with our audience, not work against them. And so we will put them at the center of every decision we make.”Chapek also thanked employees who had to work from offices, studios or theme parks, and those working from home while balancing childcare needs. Chapek added that “our long-term goal is to provide greater flexibility,” suggesting that the company could adjust its in-office plans in the future.Read Chapek’s full memo, below.Team,As we begin the New Year, I want to share our mission and the strategic pillars that will be key to our success—but first, I want to start 2022 on a note of gratitude for all of you, your talent, dedication, and optimism during the most disruptive time in our company’s history.Thanks to you, we are weathering the pandemic and emerging stronger than ever. Over the last two years, we continued to tell the world’s best stories, reorganized, and accelerated our transformation to better serve audiences and guests. We looked inward during a time of social disruption, saw how much was left to do, and made significant change. And of course, we underwent a leadership change—and I am enormously grateful for the tremendous foundation Bob Iger left us.You achieved those things during a once-in-a-century pandemic, and I want to acknowledge those whose roles require them to be in the office or one of our parks, as well as those working from home while managing at-home learning and gaps in childcare. I also appreciate your patience as we begin reopening our offices. Our long-term goal is to provide greater flexibility, and your leaders will be in touch as plans evolve.It’s ironic that this disruption is happening as we prepare to celebrate our company’s 100th anniversary. For nearly a century, we have defined and redefined entertainment, created countless lifelong memories, and delighted fans and families around the world. It’s a legacy that is simply unrivalled—and a welcome responsibility for us to build upon.And so I believe our mission for this year is clear: set the stage for our second century, and ensure Disney’s next 100 years are as successful as our first. To do that, we will focus on three pillars.First, storytelling excellence. What makes Disney so unique is that the stories we tell mean something to people. They inspire, give hope, bring us together, illuminate the world around us, and create memories. That is Disney magic, and we must continue to set the creative bar higher and higher. To that end—and in addition to all my other creative meetings—I am establishing a new standing monthly meeting with our senior creative leaders to discuss the opportunities we face as a storytelling enterprise. This will encourage collaboration, sharing of best practices, and stimulate cross-studio ideation.Second, innovation. Since Steamboat Willie, we have been the world’s foremost innovative storytellers. That must continue as technology evolves, giving our creative teams new canvases like the metaverse on which to paint. We should be especially innovative as we seek to bring stories to life in new ways—particularly if they enhance what many call our “franchise ecosystem,” which is one of the things that sets us apart.And third, relentless focus on our audience. We are a big company with many constituents and stakeholders, all of whom have a place in our decision-making. But at the end of the day, our most important guide—our North Star—is the consumer. Right now, their behavior tells us and our industry that the way they want to experience entertainment is changing—and changing fast thanks to technology and the pandemic. We must evolve with our audience, not work against them. And so we will put them at the center of every decision we make.When you look at the entertainment landscape, I believe Disney stands alone. We have the world’s most creative storytelling engine along with the world’s most beloved brands and franchises—which we can bring to life in ways no one else can. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms across the world—including powerful streaming services—with the ability to reach audiences anywhere, anytime. We have the #1 news organization and the most trusted brand in sports. We bring people together and make magical memories that last a lifetime at our parks and on our cruise ships. We have a unique ability to impact culture and connect with people on deeply personal levels. And we have you—the best team in the business.I couldn’t think of a better combination, and I could not be more optimistic about our future. I look forward to setting the stage for our next century with all of you, and to making the unique brand of magic that only Disney can.Bob"
Business strategy change,https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Danahers-Instruments-of-Change,Danaher’s Instruments of Change,"Illustration by John HerseyParticipants were Dan Comas, Thomas P. Joyce Jr., Bill King, Kevin Klau, George Koenigsaecker, Jim Lico, Chris McMahon. Henk Van Duijnhoven, Steve Simms; moderated by George Roth and Art Kleiner.​When the Danaher Corporation announced in May 2015 that it would split into two separate enterprises in 2016, it seemed at first like a reversal of the company’s history. Danaher had built itself into a remarkably successful business over four decades by acquiring and integrating new companies into a unified whole, improving them through a group of distinctive management practices known as the Danaher Business System (DBS), then holding onto them. Although it’s sometimes compared to a private equity firm, Danaher is different — it buys and builds companies for the long term, not for rapid fix-up and sale. Divesting is not the Danaher modus operandi.But from a strategic point of view, the split makes sense. Although these two new companies have a common heritage and management approach, their businesses are distinct enough from each other that they require different capabilities.One new company, which will retain the Danaher name, will focus on science and technology businesses. Generally, these are enterprises with resilient business models, strong long-term growth, high gross margins, and significant business in aftermarket products, such as replacement parts and upgrades. The other company, Fortive Corporation, will be made up of what Danaher calls its “industrial growth” enterprises. These are industrial end-market businesses with slightly more cyclical markets, high operating margins, and strong cash flow. The split is intended to provide each company with its own focus and to increase capital deployment flexibility, thus providing more opportunities for growth in each company’s distinctive way.Distinctive capabilities have been central to Danaher’s success since the mid-1980s, when Mitchell Rales and Steven Rales, two brothers who owned a commercial real estate business, discovered they had a knack for buying and turning around ailing manufacturing companies. Over the years, the company had evolved from a highly leveraged startup to a profitable family of ventures with a market capitalization of more than US$40 billion in 2013. The Raleses, who had named Danaher after a Montana creek where they often fished, had invested heavily in the management skills of the people who ran it and its member firms. They and the other company leaders had developed a unique approach they called the Danaher Business System. This intensive continuous improvement program, derived from the Japanese quality movement, was augmented with homegrown approaches to innovation, commercialization, and leadership development that involved every level of management and were led directly by the company’s successive CEOs.At strategy+business, we have covered Danaher’s prowess with acquisitions (see “The Capabilities Premium in M&A,” by Gerald Adolph, Cesare Mainardi, and J. Neely, s+b, Feb. 22, 2012, and “Deals That Win,” by J. Neely, John Jullens, and Joerg Krings, s+b, July 14, 2015), but it wasn’t until we researched the book Strategy That Works (see “Creating a Strategy That Works,” by Paul Leinwand and Cesare Mainardi) that we realized how far Danaher’s capabilities have taken the company. The executive interviews in this roundtable were conducted in 2012 and rechecked and updated for this article. They show how an enterprise that organizes itself around what it does best can generate a long-term track record of consistent success.Danaher’s Identity Profile With headquarters in Washington, D.C., Danaher is a group of companies that produce instrumentation and solutions for a broad range of end markets, including healthcare diagnostics, life science research, industrial manufacturing, maintenance, and service. With a global workforce of 71,000, it had revenues of $19.9 billion in 2014. Since 1980, its annualized returns to shareholders have been three times as high as those of the Standard & Poor’s Industrials Index. A split into two enterprises, Danaher and Fortive, is planned for the second half of 2016. Value proposition: As a “company that builds companies,” this consolidator adds value through M&A and operational excellence. Its member companies are B2B category leaders, consistently offering high-quality products and solutions to professional, medical, industrial, and commercial customers. Capabilities System Acquisition and integration: Danaher succeeds by acquiring and integrating companies that will thrive within its culture and with its capabilities system.Danaher succeeds by acquiring and integrating companies that will thrive within its culture and with its capabilities system.

Portfolio of products and services: Danaher has more than 40 businesses spanning five segments: industrial (Kollmorgen, Videojet); test and measurement instruments (Fluke, Tektronix); dental (Kavo, Kerr); life sciences and diagnostics (Beckman Coulter, Radiometer); and environmental (Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root). —Adapted from Strategy That Works: How Winning Companies Close the Strategy-to-Execution GapOriginal SystemsDan Comas: The founders, Steve and Mitch Rales, started out in the 1980s with a real estate company. They bought some poorly run manufacturing companies, and discovered they could rebuild them and run them profitably. It was a better business than real estate. Between 1985 and 1990, their little company went from almost nothing to a market cap of about $400 million.George Koenigsaecker: The Danaher Business System was born in 1986, when I was the president of the Jacobs Manufacturing Company in Bloomfield, Conn. “Jake Brake” was a formerly family-owned business that made brakes for diesel trucks. In 1984, the company had merged with Chicago Pneumatic, a maker of power tools and industrial equipment, which Danaher subsequently bought.Jake Brake was profitable, but it was ready to collapse because it was abusive to its customers, who began to look for alternatives. I had been convinced of the power of the lean approach ever since I had worked with a Japanese–U.S. joint venture several years before. So I started to adopt that approach as a laboratory for change.In early 1988, I learned that Yoshiki Iwata and Chihiro Nakao, two Toyota Production System sensei who had been handpicked disciples of its chief architect, Taiichi Ohno, were teaching at the University of Hartford. I took them to dinner and asked if their consulting company, Shingijutsu, could help us. Before saying yes, they demanded to see the plant, right away. There was a lot of anti-Japanese sentiment then, especially in the United Auto Workers, our union. So when I arrived at 11 p.m. with two Japanese guys, it got the attention of everyone on the night shift.As we walked around, Iwata made little jabs: “It’s a big warehouse. Where is your factory?” We were obviously buried in work-in-process. He said it was the worst factory he’d ever seen: “You should be fired immediately.” Finally, we got to our most important cell. “Would you like to fix it now?” he asked.The machine layout was backward. We’d set it up clockwise. If we changed it to counterclockwise, each worker would use his right arm, which is 3 percent stronger on average. That would get us a 3 percent productivity gain. But we would have to move all the machines.We worked until 5 a.m. redesigning the cell. This event launched a total transformation of our production system. We started working with Shingijutsu for a week every month. There’s magic in that weeklong cycle. It’s long enough to study, make changes, and get the change semi-established. Things began to move at a blistering pace.Danaher bought Chicago Pneumatic in a hostile takeover around the same time. As the new owners, Steve and Mitch Rales came up to see what we were doing. We thought they would kill our new approach. But their lack of an operations background turned out to be a godsend. If they’d been conventional manufacturing guys, it wouldn’t have made sense to them. But fortunately, they knew nothing about manufacturing, and it seemed logical — plus we were delivering strong productivity numbers. They asked us to make a presentation at Danaher’s first-ever corporate meeting, later that year. Soon after that, we had established these practices as the beginning of the Danaher Business System.Jim Lico: That Jake Brake plant is still a Danaher subsidiary. It has a huge market share, great customer satisfaction, and a high level of quality. Its example showed us the power of lean production in turning a business around — and in funding acquisitions by generating cash from operations. Probably every senior leader at Danaher can tell the story of saving the Jake Brake plant. It’s passed down from one generation of leaders to the next; it helps us learn why we are who we are.Steve Simms: As we grew the company through acquisitions, we rolled out the Danaher Business System to each new piece. We set up kaizen [continuous improvement] sessions and policy deployment [PD] reviews for every business. [PD reviews, also called hoshin meetings, are in-depth structured sessions used to assess progress toward previously agreed-upon goals.] We encouraged team members at every level of the company to take responsibility for specific pieces. Whether you’re in a strategic plan review, an operating review, or a growth initiative, or walking the plant floor, all the questions and challenging come back to some aspect of “How do we get better?”This isn’t something we would just talk about before an analyst conference or board meeting. People at Danaher talk about it every single day. It leads to great, rich discussions everywhere, including parts of the business outside the factory. You go to people down in payables for a day sales outstanding [DSO] number, and they say they don’t have it. You can push back, suggesting they use some of the DBS [Danaher Business System] tools or conduct a PD review, and you figure out something together. That’s how business is supposed to work.Comas: In 1989, the Rales brothers hired George Sherman to become CEO. George was the chief operating officer — the number two guy — at Black & Decker, a much larger company at the time. Steve and Mitch, who can be very persuasive, must have convinced him that there would be a better future here.Simms: The culture evolved from the top. With George Sherman there was no confusion; DBS was the only way to run the business. George was as conversant and skilled in the tools as anybody I’ve ever met. He was succeeded as CEO in 2001 by Larry Culp, who further reinforced our practice. Larry posted notes for all staff on the company’s intranet every day. We’d call it blogging today. He’d write about that day’s kaizens. Something like, “It’s 9:00 at night and Simms is supposed to be meeting me, but he’s not here because his team is still in the plant moving equipment.” The excitement and constant attention became part of the culture. Senior managers were actually rated every year on their proficiency with the DBS tools.Once a year we gathered for the Danaher Leadership Conference — a series of 40 or 50 presentations over three days highlighting best practices for the top 100 to 150 leaders at the operating companies. One example could be a story about how the water quality platform has captured customer insights for accelerated product development.Another could be, “We finally learned to do policy deployment right after 15 years.” Each presentation explained a problem, the root cause, the countermeasures taken to solve it, what [the people involved would] do differently in retrospect, and what they’d advise you to do — with an email address and phone number. “Call me, and we’ll talk about some ideas and people to help get you started.”Building CapabilitiesHenk Van Duijnhoven: We generally start teaching the Danaher Business System through classroom work and then move to actually applying this improvement at gemba [where the work is done: for example, the manufacturing floor, R&D, the lab, or on sales calls]. When people participate in the implementation of tools, that is as good a learning experience as you can have. We tie together culture, capability building, and people development this way.Lico: The top 25 executives at Danaher, including the CEO, all teach two or more weeks per year. In those sessions, they don’t just teach; they create an environment where leaders can talk about the challenges of their business. We have had kaizens with the CEO on teams, in factories, and on the shop floor.Simms: All senior executives regularly teach the tools where they are certified. Before I retired, I was a black belt with some of these tools, which meant I had a commitment to lead others to use them and be evaluated on the results. I often taught at companies in other parts of Danaher that didn’t report directly to me. It would signal a high level of importance when I spent a week facilitating a team that wasn’t even in my group.We always tried to incorporate new things into DBS to have it grow and change as the portfolio changed. Lots of companies use the DBS tools as individual techniques. Danaher makes the tools part and parcel of the culture. When I was recruited to Danaher from Black & Decker, I immediately recognized that the culture was unique and very powerful. My effectiveness and leverage were far greater than anything I had seen elsewhere.The senior management is quite good at calling out “fake DBS.” It might be pretty charts in three dimensions and perfect colors. Or a cell diagram presented by someone who can’t walk you through it when you ask them to. Danaher has a fact-based culture. As long as you have the facts or are willing to get them, you’re safe. If you’re touting pabulum, that’s an unsafe place to be.Chris McMahon: The company doesn’t get distracted by fads, like Six Sigma or management by objectives. We’ve kept a very consistent long-term approach and method. We just roll up our sleeves and do it. We know we will fail a hundred times before we get it right. But with businesses that have demonstrated this discipline around core processes and tenets, slow and steady wins the race. That has helped Danaher focus on long-term growth, long-term margin expansion, and maintaining a great cash flow record over many years.Lico: We have been learning how to extend DBS to a larger and larger scale for more than a decade. In 2003, when I was running the DBS office, Mitch Rales asked me how I was going to teach DBS to 24,000 people in the next three or four years. I said, “We only have 24,000 people in the company.” Mitch said, “Yeah, but we’re going to double in size in the next three or four years and that’s our task.”As we get larger, we want each operating company thinking about how to scale DBS in its own way — as opposed to somebody at corporate deciding. We’ve also become more codified than we were in the early days. We do more formal training and leadership development.Van Duijnhoven: Often new tools emerge from discussions of the Danaher leadership team, which is the top 20 leaders, most of whom operate companies in the Danaher system. This group gets together several times a year. When we develop a new approach — for example, a lead-generation tool for Web marketing — there’s not some committee that does it; we all become students. We quickly pick up everything we can from one another; then we make sure that it works in our environment.We typically implement a new tool by experimenting with it at a Danaher company that is already reasonably good, trying to take it to the next level. Then we take what we learn to a few other companies. Often within 12 months, we’ve gone to all the operating companies to demonstrate the tool. Not every operating company has to implement every tool; they choose the tools that will enable them to achieve their strategic goals, fix quality issues, or improve delivery or other operating company objectives. Product life-cycle management fits companies that have an active product pipeline, but it might not be important for one of our businesses like ChemTreat, which provides solutions for industrial cooling problems.Thomas Joyce: A process orientation is fundamental to DBS. The tools we use may not always be easy, but they must be repeatable, sustainable, teachable, and simple.Simms: In the early 2000s, [then CEO] Larry Culp asked if I’d be willing to lead a team to identify opportunities for organic growth, beyond what we already had. This came from an analysis that correlated organic growth and superior shareholder value. We looked at different ways of thinking about product development and innovation inside and outside the company. We talked about advanced skills in sales, and pricing as a strategic weapon.We looked for companies that were best in class; we sent a team of people to Procter & Gamble. It’s a radically different company, but its concepts on innovation stretched our thought process and led us to do a number of things differently. We went to Starbucks several times to look at customer management. We talked to experts on pricing and pricing analysis.We customized what we learned to fit the Danaher culture. Then we piloted the resulting organic growth tools with targeted Danaher companies where we thought we had the greatest opportunity and capacity. Finally, we rolled it out across Danaher, by asking every business to talk through a simple matrix of strategies and growth tools. “If we’re going to be successful in organic growth, which tools are going to get us there? How do you build the internal muscle to be able to eventually lead that process yourself?”Meaningful MetricsComas: We hear the same thing from everybody who joins the company: Danaher is incredibly metric-oriented. We measure everything on a real-time basis — always monthly, often weekly, sometimes daily, and even hourly when you get down to a cell in a factory.McMahon: In 2006, we stepped back and realized that we had 150 key performance indicators. We were driving ourselves crazy with all these metrics and data. We decided to narrow it to just the most important metrics. Those are our eight core value drivers. We had to do this if we wanted to scale up.Joyce: The first four core value drivers are core growth, operating margin expansion, working capital returns, and return on invested capital. Those are the four shareholder-facing financial metrics.The next two are customer-facing metrics. On-time delivery is measured against when the customer wanted us to deliver something (even if that is yesterday). External quality is a broad measure of every dimension of a customer experience.There are two associate-facing metrics. The internal fill rate is the percentage of managerial positions we fill with internal candidates. Retention is the last metric. Every Danaher business uses those eight metrics to answer the question: Are we winning?In each business, we have a disciplined cadence of monthly operating reviews: eight-hour face-to-face meetings with a standing agenda and 20 monthly objectives for each business. The operating review is always held at the local business, not in Danaher’s headquarters in Washington. It’s very data-driven. We focus on things that are not going well and what we’re going to do to improve them.But the response to metrics is as important as the numbers. If an operating review shows green on all 20 monthly objectives, we know we probably have an issue. The objectives weren’t tough enough. And if they’re red on 10 out of 20, the way the team responds matters. You don’t want them to view it as OK, but you don’t want them demoralized, either. You want them to rise to the challenge, adopt stretch objectives, and seek to improve.We try to remember this is about winning in the eyes of our customer. People want to win because winning is fun.You can walk up to a visual board on the shop floor in any Danaher business, and the metrics have the same labels: safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory. You can look at progress against clear targets — monthly, weekly, and daily cell-level targets. With that kind of visibility and transparency in performance, it’s easy to call it the way you see it. You can start a discussion by saying, “Based on the data, we’re not making progress.”We try to remember this is about winning in the eyes of our customer and against the competition in the market. People want to win because winning is fun.Simms: In our strategic planning, we come back to two questions. “What game are we trying to play? How are we going to win within that space?” Everyone is expected to be able to answer those two questions in relatively simple terms.A Superior M&A CapabilityComas: Our approach to finding acquisition targets was 20 years in the making. It started when we decided we would not wait for Goldman Sachs to call us with their prospects. Instead, we did our own up-front research into prospective markets and started to build funnels of names of companies to buy and industries to enter.Van Duijnhoven: Other companies try to make one perfect bet. That’s a risky way of letting senior executives with no experience sit on a lot of cash. Instead, we continue to explore many acquisitions and bring a significant number to fruition. When you acquire frequently enough, you learn what to do and what not to do. You develop skill at assessment and integration, and you learn to hold these assets over a longer time than might happen in private equity.Our main criterion for M&A: Through this acquisition, can we ultimately become one of the market leaders in that industry?Our main criterion: Through this acquisition, can we ultimately become one of the market leaders in that industry? That typically requires that we pick up one of the stronger brands or assets within that industry, and that we generate at least as much value as, if not more value than, the current owners do.Bill King: Often, when you do one deal, everybody thinks you’re not going to do another, so competitors come in thinking they have an advantage. On the contrary, we look for complementary companies to buy before we make an offer. When we bought Beckman Coulter in 2011, we were already aware that we wanted to buy Blue Ocean Biomedical, a cytometry firm that could reinvigorate Beckman’s hematology business. We snatched it up within six months of closing on Beckman.Joyce: We have a very disciplined M&A process. It starts with having a clear sense of what markets we find attractive. We look for large global markets with good growth profiles and generally low cyclicality. We also look for the ability to develop sustainable competitive advantage through a brand and intellectual property. We also look, obviously, for good profitability and low capital intensity. If we don’t like the market, we don’t bother looking at specific companies.Comas: We find that businesses with more branded products, especially those used by professionals, are inherently more profitable. Their products have more pricing power. They are also often poorly managed from a cost perspective. They’re making money from their technology and brand, but manufacturing, supply chain, and the back office are afterthoughts. We sometimes have to explain to analysts why these companies, which might have a 50 percent gross margin, are attractive. It’s easier to improve their performance than it would be to improve a very well-managed manufacturer of industrial products that has a 25 percent gross margin. It sounds counterintuitive until you think about it.McMahon: We do 12 to 14 deals a year and turn down 10 times that, so we’re doing 150 due diligences a year all over the world. We do extensive due diligence on each one. Our pre-acquisition investigations, especially on the finance side, are designed to dig up, expose, and share every bit of risk, making sure we all know what we’re getting ourselves into. If something looks scary, let’s make sure we sit around the table and figure it out or walk away. We try to be patient and not to get emotionally tied to any particular investment.Joyce: Larry Culp, my predecessor as CEO, could tell you stories about how long he cultivated Kathryn and Clifford Hach before acquiring the company they founded, the Hach Company, in 1999. It would make you wonder why we didn’t give up a lot sooner, but the model has proved successful. You’d have to go back to our earliest days to find a hostile takeover.Comas: We might say to a company leader, “You don’t know us, but we’re interested in this space, and one day, if you think of selling your business, please talk to us. We have a long-term point of view and would like to stay in touch over time.” That’s proven to be a very powerful tool. At any point we’re probably cultivating 200 companies that aren’t for sale today. We’ve cultivated some companies for 10 years. When they’re ready to sell, they’ll often come to us because they know we’re interested and they understand how we operate.During due diligence, we assess their potential with the same metrics we use in our daily business. “Here’s this company’s profitability today; where do we think we can get it in three years? What are the five or six building blocks to get there?” We look at it from the perspective of the factory, people, go-to-market investments, and new products.We publicly announce the return metric we want to see within a stated time period, and how we think we’re going to get there. When we started doing this, at least one banker warned us against it; it might tie our hands on a potential deal. But it’s worked the other way. Investors are comfortable with this approach. They understand that once the bidding on a deal gets up to a level where we no longer can hit our return, we move on.We also assess whether management will buy into the Danaher Business System. We have passed when we felt we could not work with the management team. On average, we probably change two or three of the 10 top roles in a new acquisition. Often we replace the CFO, because we’re very metric-oriented, and we want someone in place there who understands the Danaher metrics.Joyce: For each acquired company, we establish a target of having a strategic plan in place within 100 days of the closing of the transaction. That process creates alignment, and allows us to quickly establish and reconfirm the financial targets from our due diligence. Due diligence only goes so far, and we need the company management teams to play an integral role in defining a path for their future, in concert with us.Lico: We ask all the companies why they do what they do. People quickly understand that we’re not trying to change everything. We’re really trying to help the business be better. A famous phrase we use at Danaher is “don’t let perfect get in the way of better.”We bought Beckman Instruments because we wanted the Beckman Coulter brand of biomedical laboratory instruments. We were very aware of what it had taken to build the strength of that brand over 100 years. We knew if we tried to change everything, we would trash the culture of Beckman and lose the brand continuity. We tried to preserve what was great about that business at the same time we brought in aspects of Danaher that added value. Beckman is successful today because its leadership and the associates embraced DBS.As we buy companies, we learn new things. And those learnings are incorporated into all Danaher businesses.As we buy companies, we learn new things. The dental businesses had great sales management practices that were new to us. When we acquired Fluke and Hach, we learned better product management. When we bought Tektronix and some of the life sciences businesses, we learned more about technology development, advanced R&D, and software development. And those learnings were incorporated into all Danaher businesses. One of the most important things we can say about DBS is that it improves and changes as our portfolio changes.The Soul of a CompanyComas: We devote a lot of attention to the people we hire — both in recruiting them and in helping them be successful here. For many years we have worked with a group of psychologists to develop a custom assessment for Danaher executives, covering both talent and cultural fit. You do not come into the organization at mid-level or above without completing it.We look for people who are aggressive, smart, metric-oriented, OK with failure, nonpolitical, and not defensive. We want someone who is capable of saying, in a meeting with the CEO, “Hey, we underperformed this quarter. These are the three reasons we underperformed, and this is what we’re going to do differently to change that.”Simms: Often, the critical factor when you consider hiring an executive at Danaher is whether he or she can buy into the culture of process development and continuous improvement. For example, there might be a sales leader or manufacturing executive who has grown up in a culture of delivering his commitments through brute force or other “heroics” at the end of the quarter. At the end of the day, though, he didn’t leave a strong organization in place. That approach may be successful in some companies, but not at Danaher. Our goal is to hire, develop, and retain strong leaders who can create and continuously improve the necessary processes to achieve our goals and the expectations — without the need for brute force. That’s what creates competitive advantage.Kevin Klau: We throw key new hires into immersion. For 60 to 90 days, they don’t do their job. They are challenged with understanding the culture, experiencing Danaher in a variety of ways. It lets them build their internal network. It helps them understand what “good” looks like, and where different businesses and organizations are on their growth journeys. Then we drop them in their chairs better positioned to ask the right questions to drive performance in their function, with a better understanding about DBS, what makes this culture unique, and where to go internally to leverage best practices.Joyce: We also have an immersion process for acquisitions, aimed at the many leaders who join us that way. But when we acquire a new business, we can’t take the entire leadership team out of their jobs for weeks. Instead, we conduct immersion over a longer period of time. It may take a year or two.We put the leadership team through a three-day training that covers all the basics of DBS. It provides an orientation to the tools. We give them kaizen experiences; they go to operating reviews at other businesses. We send Danaher experts into that business for an eight-hour operating review every month.We look for a specific opportunity for performance improvement, often one that the team in the business has identified, that they have been dying to knock over for a long time. We organize our first weeklong kaizen around it, bringing together the senior team of the incoming business and some DBS leadership. We demonstrate the power of DBS tools and the fun that comes from knocking over a big problem in short order. And they start to turn the corner.Lico: We have the soul of a small company. We still remember the day when we all pitched in to ship product on Fridays if the warehouse was full, or we took a tech support call even if we were top executives. Although those days are long gone, we remember and long to keep that culture while learning and evolving in ways appropriate for our future.Comas: A lot of the leaders here like to be part of something special. We are sometimes compared to private equity firms because we are so acquisitive. We bristle at that a little, because this is not how we are wired. We rarely sell businesses. Sure, we want to monetize what we bought, just as much as private equity does, but we do it in a very different way. We aren’t passionate about selling the business. We’re passionate about building the business.Reprint No. 16109"

Business strategy change,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/27/business/jcpenney-history/index.html,How it all went wrong at JCPenney,"Editor’s Note: This story was originally published August 29, 2018.New York CNN Business —The economy is humming. Americans are eager to spend on clothes, toys and home decor. Just not at JCPenney.Smart Take JCPenney has posted a quarterly profit only twice since 2014 The company lost shoppers during the recession and by ditching popular brands CEO turmoil and billions of dollars in debt, JCPenney’s future is uncertainLeaderless, $4 billion in debt and with a stock price below $2, the besieged retailer faces an uncertain fate after posting its latest round of dismal earnings.“They’re in a leaky boat that eventually will sink,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at the Columbia Business School and a former CEO of Sears Canada and other department stores. “The prognosis for the future is not happiness.”Penney finds itself weighed down by years of errors, failed CEOs and muddled attempts to establish a clear identity with shoppers.Retail prowessJCPenney (JCP) has posted a profit in only two quarters over the past four years. In its most recent quarter, Penney lost $101 million and was forced to offer steep discounts to clear a glut of clothing piling up in inventory.Penney closed 141 stores last year is closing eight more this year. It has more than 860 left, but hundreds are in troubled malls, with leases that prevent Penney from escaping.The company’s downfall does not fit cleanly into the death-by-Amazon story of many retailers in recent years. Instead, Penney’s wounds are largely self-inflicted.Its more flexible rivals have adjusted their businesses to remain relevant. Kohl’s and Nordstrom have reinvented themselves with fresh brands and hipper stores. Discount retailers, such as TJX and Ross, have built loyal bases of value-focused shoppers.The prognosis for the future is not happiness.” Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at the Columbia Business SchoolBut Penney has lost both customers and the faith of Wall Street.Analysts say the company lacks the cash and focused strategy to compete against big box sellers Target and Walmart, which are battling for every inch in stores, and Amazon, which is gobbling up digital sales.Penney is plagued by a “lack of understanding about what it is, what it stands for, and who it wants to serve,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.Penney’s defining mistakePenney’s trouble started more than a decade ago, as sales and profit fell under CEO Myron Ullman.It lost shoppers to cheaper sellers during the recession and struggled to bring them back as the economy began to rebound.By the end of 2010, Penney’s sales had fallen 10% from their 2006 high of about $20 billion, and the company attracted the scrutiny of activist investor Bill Ackman. Ackman and real estate investment firm Vornado bought up a chunk of Penney, forced Ullman out and installed a new leadership team.Penney is still plagued by the decision it made next — tapping Apple’s retail chief Ron Johnson as chief executive.Johnson took over in late 2011, promising to make Penney “America’s favorite store.”Instead, as New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki wrote two years later, Penney became “America’s favorite cautionary tale.”Without testing shoppers’ reactions first, Penney changed its advertisements, its logo, its store designs and its pricing model, all attempts to make the retailer more palatable to wealthier shoppers.Penney ditched top private-label brands with loyal followings and introduced new ones that had little relevance to low- and middle-income customers.“Johnson walked away from the old audience and assumed that a new one would appear instantly from out of the blue,” Cohen explained.His biggest move — ending coupons and clearance sales — backfired, alienating Penney’s shoppers en masse.Johnson declined to comment for this story.Penney burned through cash under Johnson and got bogged down in an expensive and public legal fight with Macy’s over selling Martha Stewart’s kitchen line. In 2012, sales plunged $4.3 billion, a 25% fall from the previous year.With its stock in the dumps and its balance sheet damaged, Penney ousted Johnson in mid-2013, just 17 months after he took over.“A lot of trust between customers and JCPenney was destroyed during the Johnson era,” Saunders said. “Penney ended up a much weaker company.”Stuck in mediocrityPenney turned back to Ullman, the former CEO, for help. He slammed the brakes on Johnson’s strategy, and reinstated coupons and old brands.Although Ullman stabilized sales and stopped the stock from declining further — it had dropped from more than $140 a share in 2011 to around $20 — Penney found it difficult to dig out from its mistakes.As rivals adopted digital strategies and invested to improve their store experiences, Penney’s financial distress gave it little room to spruce up stores, buy trendy merchandise, and hire more employees.“We are still trying to fully recover from the self-inflicted wounds of the previous strategy,” Ullman said in early 2015, before he stepped down as CEO.Although Penney is known best for selling clothes, it turned to Marvin Ellison, a former top executive at Home Depot, to lead it into the appliance business.Ellison believed the shift would position Penney to take advantage of Sears’ collapse, but customers shrugged. Washers, dryers, dishwashers, and fridges are not major traffic drivers because shoppers only buy them once in a while, and they’re expensive to make.Sales fell flat, and Penney’s stock slumped further. In May, Ellison abruptly left Penney to head up Lowe’s, spooking Wall Street.Ellison also exited Penney with a fashion unit lacking direction and unsure of the type of brands it needed to offer to win over Millennials and moms. Ellison declined to comment.Penney, which had switched its focus from older shoppers to younger, trendier ones, is now moving back toward middle-aged women, with brands like Liz Claiborne. Jeffrey Davis, the chief financial officer, said the core customer is women over 45.“We were no longer necessarily having the broad array of merchandise silhouettes that was most important for her,” he told analysts earlier this month.What now?To escape its debt load, Penney would need to regain a chunk of the sales volume it has lost over the years, and do it at a profit.It is searching for a CEO to replace Ellison and focusing on women’s clothing as it works to clear its inventory of brands that have gone out of fashion.Joseph Thomas, a Penney spokesperson, pointed to same-store sales growth last quarter as proof the brand still resonates with shoppers.The company has changed its merchandising strategy, too. It used to buy as much stuff it needed to fill up its stores, but now it’s chasing proven sales trends.“We believe JCPenney can and will be a clear winner in the retail environment,” CFO Davis told analysts earlier this month.Cohen, however, isn’t counting on a comeback. He argues Penney has failed to offer shoppers the right merchandise or a defined identity, and is carrying too much inventory after years of bad purchasing choices.“JCPenney is nowhere,” he said. “A retailer who’s nowhere is dead because the business is always hyper-competitive and typically a zero-sum game.”"
Business strategy change,https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/starbucks-pickup-is-a-smart-covid-related-adjustment.html,Starbucks Just Announced a Drastic Change. What Every Company Can Learn From It,"Things are changing at Starbucks.Yesterday, the coffee giant released its latest SEC filing. It begins with a five-page letter ""to all Starbucks stakeholders,"" and is signed by the companys CEO and president, Kevin Johnson, and its chief financial officer, Patrick Grismer.While strikingly optimistic in tone, the letter reveals that Starbucks will close up to 400 company-operated stores over the next 18 months. It points out that the company typically closes about 100 stores in the Americas every year, primarily because of lease expirations and other circumstances.But the really big announcement is the reason behind the closures.According to the letter, the company is laying the foundation for a ""transformational phase"" that will introduce a new store format known as ""Starbucks Pickup.""""Starbucks Pickup is tailored to customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the Starbucks mobile app for pick-up, or those who want their Starbucks delivered to them by placing an order through Uber Eats,"" the letter explains.""We believe this transformation of our store portfolio, blending Starbucks Pickup stores with traditional Starbucks stores in dense metropolitan markets, will elevate the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth.""What makes this idea so radical is the fact that Starbucks built much of its brand on being what former CEO Howard Schultz described as a unique ""third place,"" the place between work and home that customers could go to meet friends, get work done, or simply hang out.Which leads us to the most powerful line in the letter:No matter the format, we know that the Starbucks ""third place"" experience occurs from the moment a customer envisions their daily Starbucks Experience to wherever they enjoy that Starbucks beverage.Wow.This is a major shift in strategy--a statement that the ""third place"" has become more symbolic than literal.Of course, it makes sense that customers wouldnt want to hang out in their local Starbucks in the middle of a pandemic. But heres the interesting thing: According to Starbucks, the data indicate that this change in customer behavior was clearly noticeable before the rise of the novel coronavirus.For example, Starbucks says that even prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, it discovered that about 80 percent of transactions in U.S. company-operated stores were for ""on-the-go"" orders. This insight led the companys leadership team to reexamine U.S. stores and devise a new strategy that could capitalize on changing customer behavior.In fact, according to the letter, this process of reevaluation and redesign of the store experience has already been underway for two years.This is more than a brilliant series of moves on the part of Starbuck--its also a lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand emotional behavior and put that knowledge to work.Lets break down what exactly Starbucks did.First, the company leveraged data from its mobile app and store sales to see clear changes in consumer behavior. At the same time, company leadership had a realization about the brand.Yes, it had taken the company years to establish its reputation as that ""third place.""Years of giving away free Wi-Fi.Years of allowing stores to become remote offices for thousands, if not millions, of people.Years of building an emotional connection between customers and stores.But with that emotional connection firmly in place (and the data to prove it), Starbucks leadership had the confidence needed to make adjustments that it hopes will allow the brand to become more efficient and improve customer experience.And now that the coronavirus has essentially changed the world, Starbucks is wasting no time executing its strategy--in fact, accelerating previous plans.We have here a great case study in how businesses can stay relevant, and take advantage of a negative situation to make positive changes.What business leaders can learn from StarbucksIf you own a business, chances are that you have changes youve been wanting to make. Maybe you were just starting to put things together. Or, maybe you already had a full strategy in place, and were searching for the right time to execute.Well, for all the negatives that Covid-19 has brought to your business, it has the potential to do one thing positive:It can give you the inspiration and the motivation to finish your plan and put it into action.But what if you didnt have any changes planned?Well, nows the time to take a long, hard look at your business, both pre- and post-pandemic.Ask yourself:What about my customers has changed in the past two to five years, and what can I learn from it?What am I not currently offering that would interest my customers?How can I improve the customer experience? How can I make things easier for them?It takes time to ponder these questions and come up with substantial answers. But once you have them, start working on a strategy to execute.If you can test it, great. But dont worry about making it perfect. Get started, and make adjustments as needed.Because if theres one thing Covid-19 has taught us, its this:"

Business strategy change,https://fortune.com/2022/03/21/ulta-beauty-ceo-diversity-strategy-gain-competitive-edge/,Why Ulta's new CEO is putting diversity at the heart of his plan,"It’s not easy to succeed one of your industry’s most successful CEOs. But David Kimbell, Ulta Beauty‘s chief executive, has a roadmap to build on his predecessor’s transformation, which has taken the chain from a mid-sized retailer to dominant national behemoth in just a few years.His lengthy list of to-dos includes an expansion into new functions, like ad sales, and new demographic markets as beauty consumers change how they shop. At the core of his plan, however, is diversity.As Mary Dillon’s right-hand man for eight years, Kimbell played a key role in Ulta’s transformation. He joined the beauty retailer as chief marketing officer and chief merchant in 2013 before becoming president in 2019, and then CEO last year.Ulta’s “winning” formula, which he helped refine, is brilliant in its simplicity: it offers consumers a broad mix of cosmetics, skincare and hair care products up and down the price spectrum, along with a fun self-serve product presentation that eschews the less interactive behind-the-counter department store approach. In contrast, its main rival Sephora, which is owned by LVMH, skews higher end and almost never operated in strip malls until its partnership with Kohl’s last year.But the beauty business is rapidly changing and Ulta has to change with it. Retailers like Walgreens,Walmart and of course, Sephora, are making a bigger play for the market, delivering a faster cadence of new beauty brands at all price points. Consumer behavior and attitudes toward beauty have also shifted as underserved segments of the market, notably women of color, demand representation.“I recognize that the playbook that we’ve used to get here is not going to drive us into the future,” Kimbell tells Fortune. “There has been so much change and disruption in the last couple of years, including broader societal changes, that we have to push more innovation, faster.”The playbook of the future involves growth in areas like wellness and ad sales. But it also requires an understanding that inclusivity is table stakes for a beauty brand. The industry’s changing tide parallels that of fashion where companies like Victoria’s Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch have faced backlash for a lack of diversity in product design and marketing.“We know historically, beauty has had unattainable standards. In our vision, it is an environment in which absolutely everyone is beautiful,” says Kimbell. But those standards have long reflected a bias in favor of white women.Ulta says it recently ramped up efforts to provide better offerings for customers of color, its fastest growing demographic. Last year, the company joined 27 other brands to sign the Fifteen Percent Pledge, a vow by top consumer companies to dedicate at least 15% of shelf space to Black-owned brands. (Sephora was one of the original signatories.) The company has made some headway on this goal over the last year, doubling the number of Black-owned brands it carries to 28, and bringing the company just over the halfway mark. Earlier this month, it began selling Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty line, which has been praised for offering cosmetics in an extensive array of skin tones.At Ulta’s investor day last autumn, Kimbell’s first as CEO, the company said it would spend $8.5 million on advertising with Black or Latino-owned agencies, among other efforts. It also invested $5 million in New Voices, a venture capital firm that invests in entrepreneurs of color, and promised to spend $50 million this year on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.“Because diversity is so inherent to the beauty category, it is critical to our efforts, and to our success long term,” Kimbell says. Last year, a report on the beauty market by Nielsen IQ predicted that Black and Latina consumers would continue to lead market growth for several more years.Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell Courtesy of Andrew CollingsNew avenues of growthKimbell’s career in the beauty business goes back decades. After completing business school at Purdue University in 1996, Kimbell spent five years at Procter & Gamble, overseeing its beauty brands in what turned out to be a serendipitous twist of fate. “I was in beauty and, frankly, not by choice,” he says.But it did prep him for Ulta. “It gave me insight into how you build businesses and brands, and connect with consumers,” he says. He later spent seven years in PepsiCo’s food business through 2008, followed by two at Seventh Generation, a Unilever division focused on eco-friendly household items.But it was in 2011 that he landed the role that would put him on the CEO path, however circuitously: CMO at U.S. Cellular. Dillon was CEO at the time and Kimbell was instrumental in her marketing efforts, Dillon previously told Fortune. When she left for Ulta’s corner office in 2013, he followed her. Thus began a partnership that continues to this day with Dillon currently serving as Ulta’s executive chairman.Now, it’s Kimbell’s turn to leave a stamp on the company and search for new revenue streams. Under his leadership, Ulta last autumn launched UB Media, which uses the mountain of customer data Ulta receives from its sales and loyalty programs to sell ad space on Ulta’s web site and on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.The retailer is also pursuing partnerships. In 2021 year, it struck a deal with rival Target to open small Ulta shops in what will be 800 of the big-box retailer’s 1,950 stores, helping Ulta reach countless more customers. Target’s overall business grew more than 30% during the pandemic and about 30 million visitors frequent its stores each week. Ulta is currently in about 100 Target stores.During Dillon’s eight-year reign that ended last June, Ulta saw annual sales triple from $2.6 billion in 2013 to $7.4 billion in 2020, before the pandemic delivered a temporary setback. The company has resumed its growth post-pandemic with 2021 sales hitting a record $8.6 billion.The current beauty boom will likely continue for the foreseeable future. P&S Intelligence forecasts that the U.S. beauty market will grow 5% yearly through 2030 and hit $129 billion in size. Although that will provide Ulta, which now has about 7% of that market, with new opportunities for growth, competition is intensifying.“The beauty category is dynamic, it’s innovative and it’s creative,” Kimbell says. “It has a long runway.”"
Business strategy change,https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00323,The Haier Road to Growth,"Start with 30 million responses on your QZone, Tencent, and other social media platforms — all to a simple question: “What do you want in air conditioning?” Then pay attention to the more than 670,000 people who take part in the online conversation that follows. You’re bound to come up with something cool — or, more precisely, “cool, not cold.” This concept, drawn from online responses, became the tagline for the Tianzun (“Heaven”), Haier’s advanced household heater/air conditioner/air purifier, released in 2014. Many Asian consumers don’t like the chilling effect of conventional temperature control. They’d much prefer to be “cool, not cold.” But there’s more to the concept than temperature. Air from most such devices in China is dry and dusty. The machines themselves are too noisy, or too likely to spread disease (bacteria live in air conditioning systems). Moreover, the machines look — well, like air conditioners.Headquarters on Haiers main campus in Qingdao, ChinaAll photographs by Wang ZhaoThe Tianzun doesn’t have any of those drawbacks. It is an obelisk-like device with a small wind tunnel that draws air through it from the room where it is positioned. It has an Internet connection, so consumers can use their smartphones to warm or cool the room while on their way home. Some consumers probably knew they wanted that feature, but they didn’t know that they wanted to see the circle’s light shift from red to blue as their air quality improved. Once they saw that happening, they were hooked. The product is targeted directly at a consumer segment that no other company, in the West or the East, has recognized, and that could end up being much bigger than a niche.Tianzun air conditioner (at left), introduced in 2014By building cooling machines based on this in-depth and multilayered approach to consumer insight, Haier is following its own core principle: “customer service leadership,” or the necessity to shape the future by giving customers what they want most (but may not have yet realized they can ask for). Even the decision to use the phrase “cool, not cold” in its Chinese advertising campaign reflects this principle. These are the words that customers use themselves, as opposed to a slogan dreamed up by a marketing professional.Just as unconventional was the cross-functional nature of the appliance’s launch. While the marketing staff digested the insights gained from Haier’s online customer interactions, manufacturing was already considering what they would mean for production, procurement was speaking directly to suppliers about sourcing feasibilities, and after-sales service was developing plans for follow-through. Because they worked closely together from the start, managers from all these functions were moving forward in concert, addressing possible disconnects as they arose. This allowed products to go to market as soon as they were designed and developed, instead of waiting for each department to throw its work “over the wall” to the next one. Meanwhile, representatives of each company function conducted conversations directly with customers, thereby adding a responsive new dimension to the company’s consumer insight capabilities.Haier’s rapid introduction of the Tianzun air conditioner is typical of the company’s track record since the late 1990s. The company is known for several distinctive capabilities: a precise understanding of consumer needs, especially in China and other emerging markets; the ability to rapidly innovate new types of appliances that meet those consumer needs; the management of complicated distribution networks, a skill honed in the complex Chinese market; and a high level of execution ability, including the automation of factories to deliver products to consumer specification. (See “Haiers Capabilities System,” below.) These attributes have served it especially well in China, allowing Haier to outcompete more experienced appliance companies such as Whirlpool and Maytag in that country. In fact, Haier’s prowess — and particularly its emphasis on “what we can do and who we are” rather than on “what we sell and how we make money” — shows the kind of capabilities needed by companies that were founded in emerging economies if they are to succeed in the global sphere.Haier’s Capabilities System Haier is one of 12 companies that were studied closely in a Strategy& research project on distinctive capabilities and coherence. Value Proposition: Haier’s “way to play” in the market (its value proposition) has gradually broadened since Zhang Ruimin became CEO in the mid-1980s. The company first took the role of a category leader, maintaining top market share because of its reputation for quality in China. Then it became a customizer (adapting its products to customer demands) and a solutions provider (helping consumers manage issues like water quality and home design). Haier now sells not just home appliances but related services, adapted to consumer demand in China, and, increasingly, other markets. Haier delivers its way to play by excelling at four differentiating capabilities. Source: Strategy That Delivers, by Paul Leinwand and Cesare Mainardi with Art Kleiner (forthcoming from Harvard Business Press, 2016)Haier is now the fastest-growing provider of appliances in the world. Since 2011, it has held the largest worldwide market share in white goods. With its upscale brands in China, such as Casarte, and its growing presence in the United States, Europe, and Japan, this US$38 billion company has moved out of the value-priced and niche appliance domain to compete directly with top-of-the-line appliances from more established companies. It has accomplished this by being a consistently coherent and capable company: staying true to its core identity as a company dedicated to solving problems for consumers, while continually reinventing itself with imagination and verve.Customer Service LeadershipMuch of the credit for Haier’s success accrues directly to Zhang Ruimin, the company’s CEO since 1984. Throughout the 30 years of his tenure, his sharp focus on customer service leadership has given the company consistency even as it propels Haier through dramatic changes. Zhang was the leader who proposed that Haier should never see itself as just a manufacturer of products, but instead as a provider of solutions to its customers’ problems. In the earliest years, that meant bringing new levels of quality and reliability to Chinese products. Later, it involved increasingly sophisticated forms of customization and new types of services. Through its simplicity and continuity, this principle has given all employees a reliable compass with which to make decisions, even in the face of disruptive market challenges such as new technologies or new competitors.Zhang Ruimin, CEO and chairman of HaierTo accomplish its goal, Haier has consistently cultivated and rewarded high-quality talent; the company has been a magnet for many of China’s most capable engineers and businesspeople. This approach is especially noteworthy within China’s cultural and social context. In a country that was just beginning to emerge from a Maoist mind-set when Zhang took the helm, the idea that success depended on the entrepreneurial efforts of individuals, recognized for their differences and rewarded for their achievements, was relatively unfamiliar. Haier has thus invested a great deal, especially for a Chinese company, in training its employees and demanding innovative ideas.Despite the success it has achieved, and its willingness to stick to one core value proposition (and one CEO) since the 1980s, the company has never become complacent. Zhang established early on that changes would be a way of life, not soon-to-be-completed episodes that must be traversed. “The only thing that we know is that we know nothing,” he says. “If you don’t overcome yourself, you will be overcome by others.”Indeed, Haier has reinvented itself at least four times. The first reinvention, in the 1980s, was the decision to differentiate the company by the quality of its products. The second, in the 1990s, was the adoption of consumer-responsive innovation, starting with (but not limited to) products for particular customer needs. The third, which took place in the 2000s, was the reorganization into a bottom-up structure, in which self-managing teams led decision making. The fourth, going on today, is the reinvention of Haier as a truly Internet-based company, open to the world in a way that few other companies have attempted, let alone realized.Haier is reinventing itself as a truly Internet-based company.Zhang did not develop this management approach on his own. From the beginning, he displayed a fervent curiosity about management and high performance, and he studied the work of leading scholars and observers, especially eminent management writer Peter Drucker. He took from Drucker, for example, the idea that the purpose of a business is not making money, in itself, but attracting and meeting the needs of customers. If a customer wins by gaining a better product or service, then everyone else should win as well, including the organization’s shareholders through increased profits, and the employees through increased income. A visit to Qingdao with Zhang and his associates can take the form of a management seminar; visitors are subjected to relentless questioning on management innovations that might be of interest to Haier. Zhang often takes his own notes, and he frequently applies the concepts to Haier — first in small experiments, and then rolled out through the company.Building a Quality BrandHaier, founded in the 1930s, was nearing bankruptcy in the early 1980s, when Zhang brought it back to life. At that time, demand for appliances was slowing down in the West after 35 years of growth. Looking to recoup, Western manufacturers cast covetous eyes on China’s emerging market. Most Chinese families lacked basic home appliances, and the offerings from local manufacturers did not meet basic standards for quality or consumer appeal. With their strong brands and relatively sophisticated technology (the automatic refrigerator icemaker and microwave oven had recently been introduced), overseas manufacturers believed that they would have an easy time in cities like Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai.But Chinese domestic firms fiercely defended their home markets by drastically reducing prices. Most of the foreign competitors, and quite a few of the emerging Chinese manufacturers as well, could not compete. General Electric chose not to enter the China market at all because it foresaw the price war. One of the Chinese companies that won this round was the Qingdao Home Appliance Company, a small collective enterprise that had made various electronic devices, including washing machines, but had recently settled on refrigerators. It had changed its name repeatedly over the years, but had always been located in Qingdao, a port in the Shandong province of northeastern China, midway between Beijing and Shanghai.A refrigerator from the early 1980s, when Zhang became managing directorThe appetite for refrigerators was so strong in China that Haier sold just about everything it produced. The Chinese consumer in those days expected poor quality and was prepared to have any new product repaired almost immediately. Nonetheless, the company was moribund. Its production line delivered only 80 units per month, including many that didn’t work. The factory was so run-down that workers had to be told not to relieve themselves on the floor, and they burned parts of the walls for heat. After three managing directors resigned in rapid succession, a 35-year-old deputy manager in the company named Zhang Ruimin was asked to find a replacement. He found no acceptable candidates, and reluctantly took up the challenge himself. But this appointment turned out to be fortuitous. Zhang was a visionary who saw that a middle class would emerge in China, a public interested not just in refrigerators, but in high-quality, branded, innovative products — made in China, but as good as or better than their Western-made counterparts.Soon after Zhang took the role of managing director, a customer wrote a letter to the factory complaining about a faulty refrigerator. This led Zhang to one of the most famous episodes of his career. “I called people from quality control down to the warehouse with me,” Zhang later recalled. “We had just over 400 refrigerators in the warehouse. We inspected them one by one. If they had any problem whatsoever, we pulled them out. We ended up pulling out 76 problem fridges. I had to change the perception [of our quality]: If products left the factory, they should be first rate.”Zhang had his incredulous employees line up those 76 defective refrigerators in the street outside the factory and publicly smash them to bits with sledgehammers. They all knew he could have sold them, or given them as political favors to local officials. But the message was clear. Never again would the Qingdao Home Appliance Company sell products it could not be proud of. Instead, it would build appliances that solved problems for its customers — the first problem being the unreliability and poor quality of refrigerators in China.Soon after, in 1985, the company reestablished itself as a joint venture with the German manufacturing company Liebherr, thus gaining access to advanced technologies. It changed its name to Qingdao-Liebherr to evoke the prestige and quality of German manufacturing. In 1992, it solidified this association by renaming itself Haier, a name the company kept even when the joint venture ended. Haier, a simplified Chinese transliteration of the second part of the German Liebherr, was chosen in part because it was easy to remember and euphonic in both Chinese and English.As part of the company’s first reinvention, a number of mutually reinforcing, granular management choices provided guidelines for day-to-day practice that made change easier to accept. To improve quality, for example, Zhang set out to foster a mind-set oriented toward performance and accountability. He borrowed routines and practices for continuous improvement from the quality movement — which was then, in the mid-1980s, first becoming visible in industries outside Japan. Zhang also linked pay to performance in a manner previously unseen in the Chinese market, through a system called “Overall Every Control and Clear” (OEC). Every day, workers tracked quality results using paper and pencil, and their wages were tied directly to the outcomes. This gave the company a simple means of establishing goals and controlling achievement for “everything, everyone, and every day,” and a way to encourage employees to constantly challenge their previous performance.For the next 30 years, the operational capability of OEC gave Haier what behavioral experts George Kohlrieser, Susan Goldsworthy, and Duncan Coombe call a “secure base” on which to build bold change. For example, the company managed logistics with a zero-defects focus, resulting in very low inventory, short delivery times, and low working capital. In the years that followed, as new business models were introduced, the disciplined mind-set of OEC was never abandoned. Instead, it was scaled up to meet ever more ambitious goals. Workers grew accustomed to taking small steps that added up to great results.The Niche InnovatorIn the late 1990s, a farmer in the Chinese countryside complained to Haier that his washing machine was full of dirt and was not functioning well. The local distributor sent a technician to the farmer’s house, where he discovered that the farmer had been using the washing machine not to wash clothes but to clean sweet potatoes. At this time, agricultural markets had been permitted to open in China, and cleaner vegetables commanded higher prices. The repair technician reported immediately to Haier’s headquarters about this practice, which was growing increasingly common in the region. Inspired, the company soon released a vegetable washing machine, designed to accommodate the extra grime and soil of the tubers.Around the same time, Haier’s researchers observed that unlike Western consumers, many Chinese people hand-washed their underclothes every day at home. They found it more hygienic and socially discreet to wash these separate from other clothes and away from public washing machines. In response to this consumer need, Haier launched a small, low-energy washing machine called the Little Prodigy that could easily fit into a small, crowded urban apartment. The machine became extremely popular, among, for example, families with newborn children.These episodes represented the start of the second reinvention at Haier: a new form of customer-responsive innovation. This was timely, because quality was no longer a great differentiator in China; other companies had caught up. Zhang built upon the company’s hard-won workforce discipline, and the accompanying performance–pay relationship, to link employees directly to customers. To break down the “invisible walls,” as he called them, between functions, Zhang assigned teams made up of members of different functional departments to specific projects. He avoided the conflicts of a matrix structure by introducing “market chains” (based on the value-chain concepts of Michael Porter), in which it was possible for all individuals at Haier, no matter what their role, to trace their actions directly to the marketplace. These market chains replaced functional silos as the key organizational unit.This was also the phase in which Zhang began building Haier into a global company. He approached this challenge by adopting Mao Zedong’s strategy of “occupying the rural areas to encircle the city,” gaining strength first with niche products for sectors where there were few competitors. The company took full advantage of its customer-responsive innovation capability to do this. In 1997, recognizing the needs of college students in dormitory rooms, it launched mini-refrigerators in the United States. It followed with wine refrigerators in 2004. And then, during the 2000s, Haier parlayed that success into becoming a mainstream producer of appliances for the U.S. market. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, Haier sold extra-large washing machines designed for heavy robes.Key to all this growth was Haier’s behind-the-scenes customer-centric operations system. Rapid innovation based on consumer demand — as with the Tianzun air conditioners released in 2014 — has become routine, because all departments work in parallel. The company’s close collaboration among R&D, marketing, and sales also works well in the U.S. market. For example, U.S.-based R&D engineers are required to talk directly to consumers in the design of new products, and their salary is linked to the sales results of the products they design.Intimacy and EntrepreneurshipIn 2005, Zhang recognized that most of Haier’s competitors in China were achieving acceptable levels of service responsiveness and that the company would once again have to reinvent its value proposition. He believed that Haier suffered from unnecessary time delays and guesswork about new product manufacturing volumes, which proved costly when it guessed wrong, and that could be reduced, if not completely avoided, by becoming more intimately aware of customer needs and wants. Employees would now have to get to know the customer better than they knew themselves, or, as Zhang put it, to “create zero distance with the customer.”Intimacy is a lot more complicated than responsiveness, and this third reinvention required employees to feel closer to their customers. Haier thus inverted its organizational structure into one based on self-organizing work units called ZZJYTs (an abbreviation for zi zhu jing ying ti, which translates to independent operating unit). Their three most critical functions — marketing, design, and manufacturing — were now supposed to work directly for customers. Instead of directing the employees who did that work, the ZZJYT managers became service providers to them, giving them the resources and guidance they needed to provide for customers. This minimized the decisions made at higher levels in the hierarchy, making the company more responsive to nascent market needs. Zhang went so far as to announce that this shift in organizational model would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of flagging, and even if it were necessary to use some of the returns from successful legacy offerings to make it work.The new structure proved successful, and the ZZJYTs are still the basic organizational unit at Haier. Each comprises a team of 10 to 20 people — sometimes located in one place, other times virtual — who come from various functional roles and are brought together for a specific mission, and who are given profit and loss responsibility and accountability. They have their own independent accounting systems and complete autonomy in hiring and firing employees, setting internal rules about expenses and determining bonus distribution, and making almost any operational decision that typically would be made by an independent functional organization.Haier organizes its ZZJYTs in three tiers. First-tier ZZJYTs have the task of directly facing the market, understanding customer needs, and providing customers with the right products. Second-tier ZZJYTs are responsible for supporting the first-tier ones, providing them with the resources and the guidance they need. Third-tier ZZJYT managers are the business division managers or functional managers who set corporate strategies and direction for the whole group. A typical first-tier ZZJYT is composed of sales, R&D, marketing, and finance people. Everyone, whatever their function, is expected to talk to consumers regularly.To Zhang and others at Haier, this organization design represents an explicit effort to avoid being disrupted by technological change. They wanted to make sure that top management would heed early warning signals of disruption, especially those that came from internal staff, and adjust to new realities rapidly and painlessly. Thus, at Haier, the time of information flow between the customer (the top) and coordination (the bottom) is minimized. Because R&D and marketing people work in the same ZZJYTs, they meet frequently, particularly when new products are considered. Salespeople keep in close touch with customers, so they can estimate the order numbers with a smaller variance than if they were relying only upon forecasts. Once the products are ready for shipment, they go first to the waiting-list clients, and only afterward to retail outlets. This way, Haier keeps inventories low, which saves storage costs and working capital.The ZZJYTs are not permanently assigned to a particular product or role. Instead, they are formed through internal competition; participants must apply to work on projects that appeal to them. Winners are chosen on the basis of the quality of their product or service ideas, the attractiveness of their business model, and the feasibility of their go-to-market planning. When Haier made the strategic choice to launch a three-door refrigerator, for example, it invited its employees to compete for the role of leading this initiative by submitting business plans and business models explaining how such a product could best succeed. The company’s $1.5 billion three-door refrigerator business is now led by the winner of that competition, 38-year-old Pu Xiankai. He was selected, despite his relative youth, because he described the product in an imaginative way. Once appointed to this position, it was incumbent upon him to select a team and to find manufacturers and marketers within Haier to produce and sell his products. Today, he oversees what Haier calls a “community of interest,” that is, people throughout the company, and external partners along a value chain, who have made a commitment to help his team.The activities of all the ZZJYTs are linked by internal contracts. For example, if the three-door ZZJYT needs market research data about a certain region of China, it entertains proposals from the several marketing ZZJYTs that provide such services, as well as looking outside Haier. The ZZJYT leaders also know that they cannot develop all the cutting-edge technologies they need in-house. Therefore, willingly embracing the concept of open innovation, they collaborate with organizations everywhere they operate — which is how the company ends up working with the best universities and research institutes in the world.To provide talent for the ZZJYTs, Haier created an internal labor market. Now the right number of employees with the right skills gravitate to the right organizational positions at the right time. Instead of offering its employees jobs, the company offers everyone a continuing series of opportunities to find jobs, considering the contributions they have already made. “The level of scrutiny takes some getting used to,” says Fu Haining, the chairman of the LongLongigo group, which operates Haier retail stores in China. “In the beginning, it can be a little painful, because the culture of constant challenge can make you feel like what you’ve done, what you’ve achieved, isn’t recognized. Later, you come to realize that this is what it takes to stay ahead in an extremely competitive market.”An Internet-Based PlatformAfter its first three reinventions, Haier looked nothing like a conventional modern complex organization. Its culture — embracing rather than resisting change, while holding true to its original core principle of customer service leadership — is the most important asset of the company today.But Zhang, in recent years, has questioned the ability of even this level of innovation to succeed. Inspired by the success of the latest wave of Internet-based companies, he is currently launching a fourth reinvention, this one involving the Internet. This is known at Haier as the “networking strategy.” Even the ZZJYTs, the focal point of the previous wave’s business model, are slated for dramatic change. Zhang has proposed eliminating the current second-tier ZZJYTs, presently home to most of Haier’s middle managers. The company would instead become a collection of platforms, each able to adjust to changes in the consumer market by drawing on support and collaboration from the others.This new Haier approach involves opening up the company to intensive collaboration not just with customers, but with innovators around the world — including with competitors. “The platform helps us attract first-class resources,” says Lei Yongfeng, the R&D director for PAC, Haier’s air conditioning platform. “It could be R&D resources based at a university or at a technology company. In the past, our relationship with a supplier like Mitsubishi might have consisted of us going to them and giving them the specs for a new air conditioning compressor. Now, they can see for themselves what our customers are asking for. The direct view they get makes them more responsive, which in turn helps our innovation efforts.”Lei Yongfeng, director of R&D for the Tianzen (Heaven) air conditionerWater purification is another example of the increasing scope of Haier’s collaboration. The company entered the business through a joint venture with the Strauss Group, an Israeli technology firm, which provided the technology while Haier focused on marketing, distribution, and service. But then Haier broadened its platform to include many other R&D partners; for instance, it shares more than 20 water purification patents with Dow Chemical.The result is a new level of proficiency that goes beyond anything Haier has done before. For example, the company now uses Internet access to customize every product it sells in China, whether bought in a store or online. Customers choose the color combinations, features (such as the number and layout of shelves in the refrigerator), and ancillary design elements (like the pattern of sparkles on a high-end appliance). Factories routinely make them to order. The process is not unlike choosing the accessories on a new car, except that there tend to be more choices.The Internet connection also makes customers more likely to buy a water purifier — which is sold only by consultation. Haier reps are trained to look up the complex data on China’s water problems, which vary by neighborhood, and to install the filters that guard against that neighborhood’s mix of chemicals and pollutants. On its website, which has an active consumer-to-consumer dialogue, the company posts water quality information for 220,000 communities in China. “We want people to be able to find all their water-related answers at Haier,” says Qu Guinan, the general manager of the Haier water treatment company. Building on its success to date, the company is now exploring partnerships with local communities to manage their water purification efforts community-wide.Qu Guinan (left) and Jiang Hanke, two executives from the water purification programThe Internet has enabled the company to expand its service diligence; it provides intensive installation as part of any appliance sale (a rarity in China), and, using monitoring signals from the appliances, it conducts follow-up calls with customers when the equipment is not working. The company also keeps in touch personally just in case the monitoring has missed some cause of dissatisfaction. The connection to customers has helped Haier migrate many people from their medium-value line of household appliances (the original Haier) to the more upscale Casarte brand. The phrase “the information is more valuable than the product” has already become a slogan throughout Haier.“We’re providing information to Chinese households,” says Jiang Hanke, social media director for the water purification platform, “but we’re also benefiting from these interactions. They give us a better understanding of users’ needs. Users can see what the water-quality situation is in their communities and use that information to select filtration products that suit them best. Although we didn’t set up the online resource with the direct goal of making sales, it has had that effect; sales in this still-young business have risen by a factor of four since we’ve introduced the online resource.”Zhang recognizes the high stakes that are involved in changes of such magnitude: “There will be an earthquake [within our company] if it is not properly handled.” But he also believes it is the only course of action that will allow such a large company to succeed in an era when each new triumph leads to new problems. The goal of a large company, he says, is to “lose control step by step.” In other words, Zhang believes that Haier isn’t unique. Every major organization will have to learn how to maintain its identity, the quality of its products and service, and its customer relationships, while being prepared to give up everything else. Haier’s role in this new world will be as a pathfinder: It’s already the first leading global consumer manufacturing company from China. Soon, if Zhang is once again correct, it will be the first company from anywhere with its distinctive, innovative form of management."
Business strategy change,https://hbr.org/2021/03/an-esg-reckoning-is-coming,An ESG Reckoning Is Coming,"The push in recent years for companies to commit to ESG efforts is commendable. But so far, those efforts have yielded scarce results. For companies to be held accountable to these efforts, the authors suggest three accountability mechanisms: 1) Companies should be required to publicly report on their social and environmental impact with clear, standardized, and easy-to-understand metrics; 2) Consumers, employees, and investors all have a role to play in holding companies accountable; and 3) Companies who are serious about becoming more sustainable, inclusive, and socially responsible should consider becoming certified as benefit corporations.In 2018, the clean tech darling Nikola posted a video of its new electric truck driving down a remote stretch of road, framed by dramatic music and a setting sun. The caption read: “Behold, the 1,000 HP, zero-emission Nikola One semi-truck in motion.”The video promised something with the potential to upend an industry. Investors shared the enthusiasm. Last summer, Nikola was briefly more valuable than Ford, despite yielding zero revenue.But the video was fake. The company towed the truck to the top of a hill and filmed as it rolled down. You have to hand it to them: There is no cleaner power than gravity.Nikola’s goal is “to revolutionize the economic and environmental impact of commerce as we know it today.” It’s a lofty ambition, and one shared by a growing number of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and investors hoping to reform capitalism from the inside — to make companies more sustainable, inclusive, and socially responsible.The movement to reform capitalism has seen a wave of converts in recent years. The Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of the country’s largest companies — from Comcast to Coca-Cola, Walmart to Wells Fargo — issued its Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation in the summer of 2019. In so doing, it joined a broad coalition — from U2’s Bono to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — who want capitalism to serve workers, customers, and the environment in addition to shareholders. Investors with $100 trillion of assets under management have signed on to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which advocates for a greater focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in investing.As investors who helped launch Bain Capital’s social impact fund, we applaud the commitment to reorient business toward the greater good. But we should approach the latest commitments to ESG with skepticism.What actually happens when investors with $100 trillion of assets commit to investing more responsibly? The answer is not much — at least so far.According to research last year, investors who signed onto the United Nations principles did not improve the social and environmental performance of their investments. According to the researchers, signatories “use the PRI status to attract capital without making notable changes to ESG.” Similarly, signatories to the Business Roundtable statement have performed no better than other companies in protecting jobs and worker safety during the pandemic.When companies offer insincere commitments or overpromise transformation, they risk undermining the real work being done by others. Most people struggle to differentiate bad-faith recycling claims from substantive actions to eliminate waste, like Unilever’s commitment to cut its plastic use in half or Philips’s to repurpose all of its used medical systems. Or to differentiate temporary payments for workers during the pandemic from permanent improvements, like Costco’s announcement it would raise baseline pay to $16 an hour, more than double the national minimum wage.Token programs and philanthropic side projects erode the public’s trust and invite backlash against the reform movement itself. A movement meant to benefit the public good risks becoming a buzzword coopted to keep maximizing short-term profits.So how do we ensure that these companies follow through on their commitments? We suggest three ways to align the work of corporations with creating a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous economy.First, companies should be required to publicly report on their social and environmental impact with clear, standardized, easy-to-understand metrics, such as carbon emissions, investments in training programs, and proportion of workers earning a living wage. As it is, companies can decide what — if any — social and environmental data to report. And what they do report is often self-serving. Companies publish their diversity policy, but decline to release the actual makeup of their workforce. Or they’ll report on their workforce, but not the pay disparity between groups.A century ago, financial reporting underwent a process to become transparent, standard, mandatory, and audited. This created a sense of accountability that social and environmental commitments desperately require today.There was progress on this front in September, when the world’s four largest accounting firms recommended a common set of environmental, social, and corporate governance metrics for all companies to use as part of their financial reporting processes. Sixty-one companies have now committed to these metrics, including Unilever, PayPal, and Sony. The wild west of ESG standards may soon be tamed.Second, we all need to hold corporations accountable. The latest commitments from business leaders to “do well by doing good” have centered on supporting workers, responding to racial injustice, and fighting climate change. We have the power in our roles as consumers, employees, and investors to hold them to these commitments and demand more.We are beginning to see consumers take up the cause, as they now expect companies to take a stand on social and environmental issues. And companies respond. Following the success of Burger King’s Impossible Whopper, which features a vegan patty with a tenth of beef’s carbon footprint, McDonald’s announced its own “McPlant” burger this past fall. In January, General Motors pledged to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. United Airlines has committed to reducing 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. These are consumer companies that increasingly rely on matching the values of their customers to survive.Employees are making similar demands. Tech companies are seeing workers organizing, with early unionization pushes at Amazon and Alphabet. This follows employee protests and walkouts in recent years against sexual harassment, migrant detention, and discrimination. Companies seeking to attract, motivate, and retain top talent need to understand what that talent values. For younger generations, that’s often work with a deeper purpose than just profit.Investors have some of the greatest power to hold companies accountable, especially as ESG investing has grown in popularity. Despite delivering impressive financial performance, the CEO of Rio Tinto was forced out by shareholders in the fall after the public discovered the mining company had destroyed an ancient aboriginal site in Australia.Third, companies who are serious about becoming more sustainable, inclusive, and socially responsible should consider putting their purpose into their charter and becoming benefit corporations. This new breed of companies is explicitly balancing profit with a stated public benefit, such as improving its customers’ health, creating good jobs, or restoring ecosystems.There are more than 3,500 Certified B Corps, including consumer brands like Patagonia and Seventh Generation, along with many smaller companies funded by social impact investors. In the summer of 2019, shareholders at the French food giant Danone voted to convert into the French equivalent — an entreprise à mission — with the stated purpose to “bring health through food to as many people as possible.”As evidence of the connection between a company’s social and environmental impact and its financial performance continues to grow, companies ignore these trends at their peril. Ultimately, capitalism is nothing more than the sum of individual choices. Our economy is no more moved by an invisible hand than a Ouija board is moved by invisible spirits.But if capitalists are unable to reform capitalism, it will be reformed for them. The American public is already distrustful of big business, and only half of American adults under 40 view capitalism favorably — down from two-thirds in 2010. Companies that don’t adapt will find themselves at odds with their customers, employees, investors, and regulators. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch predicted that we will soon see legal action “that goes beyond regulatory scrutiny to environmental justice, to racial inequality and ESG more broadly.” She continued: “Certain industries that may have been seen as contributors to systemic inequality may want to look at their role in undoing that inequality.” Expectations have changed; companies’ stakeholders are demanding more than hollow marketing and happy talk.Nikola, the electric truck manufacturer, presented its latest technology at an industry conference in October. It now has to prove to a skeptical public that early optimism in the company was justified. As the risk of backlash grows, this time — for ESG and for Nikola — the fight will be uphill."

Business strategy change,https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061015/how-southwest-different-other-airlines.asp,How Is Southwest Different From Other Airlines?,"Southwest Airlines (LUV) has become known over the past two decades as a thriving airline company operating in a time when most airlines have been struggling.Any company operating in the airline industry must maintain and strengthen a set of competitive advantages that differentiate it from its competitors. Southwest Airlines business model is based on extremely efficient operations, low-cost pricing, and innovative logistics solutions. Furthermore, their strategy also includes a deep focus on customer experience and looking ahead. Finally, none of this would be possible without a motivated team of employees. Through this sound strategy, Southwest achieved multiple competitive advantages that have allowed it to stay relevant in a rapidly changing world.Key Takeaways Southwest Airlines is more flexible than most other large airlines.Southwest is the only large U.S. airline that is also a low-cost carrier.Southwest Airlines strategy emphasizes recruiting and retaining motivated employees.Southwest continues to improve its business model and practices.The Only Large Low-Cost AirlineThe collapse in demand for flights throughout 2020 nearly put several airlines out of business, but Southwest was able to survive without major layoffs. When business conditions decline, only the strong survive. Southwest Airlines is strong from both a size and a cost perspective.One way of measuring strength is size. According to this theory, large airlines will experience declines, but they will not actually go out of business. Southwest is one of the big four airlines in the U.S., along with American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL), and United (UAL). That means Southwest has bigger reserves in cash, credit, and other assets than smaller airlines.Bigger doesnt always mean better, but it usually does mean safer when it comes to investing.Controlling costs is also crucial to surviving a downturn, and Southwest does well there too. Low-cost carriers, such as Southwest, have several critical advantages over their competitors. They focus on providing the lowest prices for the most popular routes, which means fewer routes will need to be abandon. Negative economic growth will also make businesses and consumers more sensitive to ticket prices, the low-cost airlines primary advantage. Southwest is the only large airline that can compete on price.The Right RecruitsWhile Southwest Airlines entire business model is important, arguably the most valuable competitive advantage has been its deep focus on hiring the right people. Southwest prides itself on being a people-oriented airline that operates with friendly and approachable employees and team members. Per its business model, Southwest hires employees who embody the companys brand messaging and who have a passion for helping customers. Southwest has stringent hiring practices and policies to ensure the right mix of team members.Southwest Airlines has a business-oriented focus on the customers experience. Part of that customer experience comes from the attitude and helpfulness of the employees it hires. However, there are many more factors that go into this competitive advantage.Flexible PoliciesSouthwest Airlines has set various policies and procedures that make flying with the airline easy. One of these is Southwests cancellation policy. They allow a customer to cancel a reservation up to 10 minutes before the flights departure. More importantly, the funds from the cancellation are available for a future trip. Policies like this one ensure that the customers of Southwest Airlines remain satisfied. These flexible policies help the airline to build high levels of brand loyalty.Rewards and PricingSouthwest Airlines also has one of the better rewards programs in the industry. Southwest gives points to customers. They can use the points to purchase future flights. It also has a partnership with Chase Bank and offers customers a Southwest credit card. The card allows them to accumulate Southwest Airlines points when making other purchases. Keeping customers engaged is a big competitive advantage for Southwest Airlines.Besides motivated employees and great customer service, Southwest Airlines offers one of the lowest-priced solutions for air travel. Its pricing strategy offers extremely low prices compared to other large airlines, such as Delta and American Airlines. Southwest had to build its business model around low operating costs to be able to offer low prices. It only has a few aircraft types, which helps the airline reduce its costs. It also services smaller airports that dont charge as much for gate access. If a customer can find a lower-priced ticket, Southwest Airlines matches the price.Continuing to ImproveSouthwest Airlines has a track record for being very forward-thinking. It is boosted by a flexible business model that supports rapid change. That puts the company in a better position to deal with the disruptions caused by economic events that are beyond its control. Southwest is always looking for lower-cost solutions, and that is more important than ever before."
Business strategy change,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/22/behind-gm-fords-new-ev-strategy-is-old-time-financing-cash.html,"Behind GM, Ford’s aggressive new electric vehicle strategy is old-time financing: Cash","In this article FGMThe cab to a Ford all-electric F-150 Lightning truck prototype is seen on an automated guided vehicle (AGV) at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, September 16, 2021. Rebecca Cook | ReutersDetroits automakers have brought a surprisingly conservative financial strategy to making EVs the next vehicle of choice for American consumers. Theyre paying cash. General Motors and Ford are investing $65 billion between them – $35 billion at GM and $30 billion for Ford – and, so far, dont propose to borrow any of it. Instead, the most radical change in auto products in a century is being paid for out of the companies operating cash flow – seriously reducing the risk to the companies over time, and, for now, boosting their stock prices. ""The short answer is that they are doing it because they can,"" said Nishit Madlani, automotive sector lead at bond rating agency Standard and Poors. ""The popularity of trucks [since the pandemic began] and strong pricing is giving them confidence."" Detroits aggressive investment and conservative financing has been years in the making. It has been aided by $4 billion borrowed by GM in May 2020, and by Ford drawing down a revolving credit line by $15 billion around the same time, moves intended to cushion a feared sales implosion from Covid-19. As sales declined more modestly than feared in 2020 and then began to bounce back in 2021, cash flow remained strong, taking the companies stock prices higher and letting Ford repay high-interest debt. At the same time, both companies held on to cash by suspending dividends and share repurchases. And the companies have cut billions in annual costs, by slashing whole lines of unprofitable sedans, withdrawing from unprofitable markets overseas, and focusing tightly on trucks, which remain the most profitable part of their business. Put all of this together, and the two biggest native-born U.S. automakers have the cash to take on the industrys biggest technological transformation since its founding.Record auto profits, record car prices""Auto manufacturers are expecting record profits once we get through supply chain issues and chip shortages, which we expect to last most of this year,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. ""The existing business is good, and the driver is car prices at a record high."" The Detroit 2s financing strategy stands in stark contrast to how Tesla, then a start-up, financed its push into EVs over the last decade. The EV leader repeatedly raised money from the stock and bond markets to pay for its plans, filing paperwork with federal regulators for $10 billion in stock sales as recently as 2020. Teslas first EV factory in California was financed with a loan that was federally guaranteed in 2010, when the EV market was nascent, before the company went public or had material revenue. GM and Ford are ready to spend even more. ""If anything, it will go up from there,"" a Ford spokesman said. The U.S. car markets bounce back to nearly 15 million units sold in 2021 provided the financial cushion Detroit needed to push forward aggressively, according to Nelson. The collapse was not nearly as large as the one that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. passenger vehicle market fell to slightly more than 10 million cars and trucks. The brief, shallow dip helped assure that the war chests of the two companies were big enough to meet the need for billions of dollars in new investment, Madlani said. ""We prepared for the known and the unknown,"" said the Ford spokesman. ""The unknown part was the pandemic. The known was that we needed to be a leader in electric vehicles. The sales rebound, while still well below pre-pandemic pace, has translated into $7.8 billion in free cash flow over the nine months that ended in September at Ford. At GM, where automotive operations barely broke even on operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2020, liquidity was still strong enough to let the company spend more than $4 billion on capital expenditures. GM is due to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 1, with Ford set to announce its results Feb. 3. Analysts expect Ford to report profits of 42 cents a share on $35.8 billion of revenue, up 75% since the September quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. GM is forecasted to earn $1.11 a share, down from $1.52 in the third quarter. GM raised its own forecast for the full year in December, saying it will earn $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, up from $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion it had previously predicted. Ford and GM profits have held up, even though U.S. industry unit sales are off the 17 million-vehicle annual pace before Covid, because the companies aggressively cut costs to prepare for the transition, Nelson said. Ford got almost entirely out of the business of making sedans, for example, and GM laid off 4,000 salaried workers in 2019. Thats in addition to factory closings that included GMs storied Lordstown, Ohio plant, later sold to EV start-up Lordstown Motors. On top of that, the companies are holding plenty of extra cash as a reserve if their cash flow misses forecasts. As long ago as 2019, analysts who spoke warily of all the money Ford needed to invest in its business respectfully noted that it also had $37 billion in cash and short-term securities. Ford now has $46.4 billion, and generated more than $12 billion in operating cash in the first nine months of 2021.Ford, GM EV forecastsBoth companies have had plenty to say about financing strategy, and EV planning, at investor conferences in the last year. The common theme: Building Fords EV strategy around existing model names like the Mustang and especially the F-150 pickup truck, for which the company has garnered 200,000 pre-orders, is paying off in both customer acceptance and cost containment. ""Within the next 24 months, based on the demand on these products, [we] would be the number two EV automaker, probably close to 600,000 EVs a year globally [from Fords current product lineup] and we dont plan to stop there,"" Fords North American chief operating officer Lisa Drake told a Goldman Sachs-sponsored investor conference in December. ""The complexity of the product in EV space is much less than at [internal combustion engines]. …And thats going to allow us to be more efficient with our capital and more efficient with the labor and the assembly plants."" At GM, the EV strategy includes a wave of new vehicles using new and existing nameplates – most recently, the company unveiled a $42,000 electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado SUV – as well as its Cruise joint venture with Honda, Microsoft and other investors to build an EV-centered autonomous-car business."
Business strategy change,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/climate-risk-and-the-opportunity-for-real-estate,Climate risk and the opportunity for real estate,"Climate change, previously a relatively peripheral concern for many real-estate players, has moved to the top of the agenda. Recently, investors made net-zero commitments, regulators developed reporting standards, governments passed laws targeting emissions, employees demanded action, and tenants demanded more sustainable buildings. At the same time, the accelerating physical consequences of a changing climate are becoming more pronounced as communities face storms, floods, fires, extreme heat, and other risks.These changes have brought a sense of urgency to the critical role of real-estate leaders in the climate transition, the period until 2050 during which the world will feel both the physical effects of climate change and the economic, social, and regulatory changes necessary to decarbonize. The climate transition not only creates new responsibilities for real-estate players to both revalue and future-proof their portfolios but also brings opportunities to create fresh sources of value.The combination of this economic transition and the physical risks of climate change has created a significant risk of mispricing real estate across markets and asset classes. For example, a major North American bank conducted analysis that found dozens of assets in its real-estate portfolio that would likely be exposed to significant devaluations within the next ten years due to factors including increased rates of flooding and job losses due to the climate transition. Additionally, a study of a diversified equity portfolio found that, absent mitigating actions, climate risks could reduce annual returns toward the end of the decade by as much as 40 percent.Leading real-estate players will figure out which of their assets are mispriced and in what direction and use this insight to inform their investment, asset management, and disposition choices. They will also decarbonize their assets, attracting the trillions of dollars of capital that has been committed to net zero and the thousands of tenants that have made similar commitments. They will then create new revenue sources related to the climate transition.Building climate intelligence is central to value creation and strategic differentiation in the real-estate industry. But the reverse is also true: real estate is central to global climate change mitigation efforts. Real estate drives approximately 39 percent of total global emissions. Approximately 11 percent of these emissions are generated by manufacturing materials used in buildings (including steel and cement), while the rest is emitted from buildings themselves and by generating the energy that powers buildings.In addition to the scale of its contribution to total emissions, real estate is critical in global decarbonization efforts for reasons likely to be compelling for investors, tenants, and governments. Significant reductions in emissions associated with real estate can be achieved with positive economics through technologies that already exist. For example, upgrading to more energy-efficient lighting systems and installing better insulation have positive financial returns. Today, newer technologies also make low-carbon heating and cooling systems, such as heat pumps and energy-efficient air conditioning, more cost competitive in many markets and climates. These cost-effective upgrades can create meaningful change while also derisking assets.We suggest three actions real-estate players can take to thrive throughout the climate transition:Incorporate climate change risks into asset and portfolio valuations. This requires building the analytical capabilities to understand both direct and indirect physical and transition risks.Decarbonize real-estate assets and portfolios.Create new sources of value and revenue streams for investors, tenants, and communities.Fundamental changes brought on by the climate transition will open new dimensions of competitive differentiation and value creation for real-estate players. More important, leaders will make a valuable contribution to the world’s ability to meet the global climate challenge.Incorporate climate change risks into asset and portfolio valuationsClimate change’s physical and transition risks touch almost every aspect of a building’s operations and value. Physical risks are hazards caused by a changing climate, including both acute events, such as floods, fires, extreme heat, and storms, and chronic conditions, such as steadily rising sea levels and changing average temperatures. Transition risks include changes in the economy, regulation, consumer behavior, technology, and other human responses to climate change.Sidebar LinkedInTwitterFacebookEmail We do mind the gap As we work with real-estate firms, we notice that investment teams increasingly recognize the impact of climate change on asset values. As one leader of valuations at a major real-estate-services firm recently commented to us: “This is the greatest deviation between modeled valuation and actual price that I’ve ever seen, and it’s because of climate.” A chief operating officer of a diversified real-estate investor told us, “We’ve seen underperformance of a cluster of our assets due to climate-related factors that just weren’t considered in our investment theses.” The industry at large senses how values are shifting. A recent survey of finance experts and professionals conducted by researchers at New York University found that those who think real-estate asset prices reflect climate risks “not enough” outnumber those who think they reflect climate risks “too much” by 67 to 1 (in comparison with stock prices, in which the ratio was 20 to 1). The International Renewable Energy Agency has estimated that $7.5 trillion worth of real estate could be “stranded”; these are assets that will experience major write-downs in value given climate risks and the economic transition, making real estate one of the hardest-hit sectors.Physical and transition risks can affect assets, such as buildings, directly or indirectly, by having an impact on the markets with which the assets interact. A carbon-intensive building obviously faces regulatory, tenancy, investor, and other risks; over the long term, so does a building that exists in a carbon-intensive ecosystem. For example, a building supplied by a carbon-intensive energy grid or a carbon-intensive transportation system is exposed to the transition risks of those systems as well. All these changes add up to substantial valuation impacts for even diversified portfolios—an increasingly pressing concern for real-estate companies (see sidebar, “We do mind the gap”).Physical risks, both direct and indirect, have an uneven effect on asset performanceSeveral major real-estate companies have recently conducted climate stress tests on their portfolios and found a significant impact on portfolio value, with potential losses for some debt portfolios doubling over the next several years. Notably, they found significant variation within the portfolios. Some assets, because of their carbon footprint, location, or tenant composition, would benefit from changes brought on by the climate transition, while others would suffer significant drops in value. The challenge for players is to determine which assets will be affected, in what ways, and how to respond. There is also opportunity for investors who can identify mispriced assets.Direct physical consequences can be conspicuous: the value of homes in Florida exposed to changing climate-related risks are depressed by roughly $5 billion relative to unexposed homes. According to the Journal of Urban Economics, after Hurricane Sandy, housing prices were reduced by up to 8 percent in New York’s flood zones by 2017, reflecting a greater perception of risk by potential buyers. In California, there has been a 61 percent annual jump in nonrenewals of insurance (due to higher prices and refused coverage) in areas of moderate-to-very-high fire risk.The indirect impacts of physical risk on assets can be harder to perceive, causing some real-estate players to underestimate them. For example, in 2020, the McKinsey Global Institute modeled expected changes in flooding due to climate change in Bristol, England. A cluster of major corporate headquarters was not directly affected, but the transportation arteries to and from the area were. The water may never enter the lobby of the building, but neither will the tenants.The climate transition will affect both individual buildings and entire real-estate marketsThe investments required to avoid or derisk the worst physical risks will drive a historic reallocation of capital. This will change the structure of our economy and impact the value of the markets, companies, and companies’ locations. These momentous changes require real-estate players to look ahead for regulatory, economic, and social changes that could impact assets.Among the most direct climate-transition impacts are regulatory requirements to decarbonize buildings, such as New York City’s Local Law 97. In June 2019, the Urban Green Council found that retrofitting all 50,000 buildings covered by the law would create retrofit demand of up to $24.3 billion through 2030. Standard property valuation models generally do not account for the capital costs required for a building to decarbonize, and investors and operators are often left with a major capital expense or tax that wasn’t considered in the investment memo.There is also a host of less direct but potentially more significant transition risks that affect whole markets. For example, some carbon-intensive industries are already experiencing rapid declines or fluctuations. In Calgary, for example, the combination of oil price volatility and market-access issues (driven by climate change–related opposition to pipelines) has dramatically depressed revenues from some buildings. Vacancy rates in downtown Calgary reached about 30 percent, a record high, as of January 2021. Investors exposed to the Calgary market have seen their asset values drop precipitously and are left trying to either hold on and hope for a reversal of fortunes or exit the assets and take a significant loss.Real-estate players should build the capabilities to understand climate-related impacts on asset performance and valuesReal-estate owners and investors will need to improve their climate intelligence to understand the potential impact of revenue, operating costs, capital costs, and capitalization rate on assets. This includes developing the analytical capabilities to consistently assess both physical and transition risks. Analyses should encompass both direct effects on assets and indirect effects on the markets, systems, and societies with which assets interact (Exhibit 1).Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.comPortfolio and asset managers can map, quantify, and forecast climate change’s asset value impactTo understand climate change impact on asset values, landlords and investors can develop the following capabilities to understand and quantify risks and opportunities:Prioritize. Create a detailed assessment of the asset or portfolio to determine which physical and transition risks are most important and which are less important (using criteria such as the probability of a risk occurring or the severity of that risk).Map building exposures. Determine which buildings are exposed to risks, either directly (for example, having to pay a carbon tax on building emissions) or indirectly (for example, exposure to reduction in occupancy as tenants’ industries decline because of a carbon tax), and the degree of exposure (for example, how high floodwaters would reach). This could require detailed modeling of physical hazards (for example, projected changes in flood risks as the climate changes) or macro- or microeconomic modeling (for example, projected GDP impacts based on the carbon price impact on a local geography’s energy production mix).Quantify portfolio impact. Combine assessments of the economic risks on individual buildings into an impact map that enables visualization of the entire portfolio (Exhibit 2). This requires combining knowledge of the potential risk or opportunity and an understanding of what drives the economics of a building (including drivers of net operating income, tenancy mix, and areas of cost variability).Take action. These capabilities cannot be isolated in a research or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) function but should directly inform investment management, lease pricing, capital attraction and investor relations, asset management, tenant attraction, development, and other core businesses. The processes within organizations must shift to ensure that climate-related insights can be a source of real competitive advantage.Exhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.comA portfolio revaluation informed by climate change risks can lead to hard choices but will also open the door to acting on decarbonization and exploring new opportunities.Decarbonize buildings and portfoliosMcKinsey research estimates approximately $9.2 trillion in annual investment will be required globally to support the net-zero transition. If the world successfully decarbonizes, the 2050 economy will look fundamentally different from the current economy. If it doesn’t successfully decarbonize, the world will experience mounting physical risks that will strain the foundations of the global economy and society. In either case, the places where people live, work, shop, and play will fundamentally change.Decarbonizing real estate requires considering a building’s ecosystemUltimately, the only way to reduce the risks of climate change is to decarbonize. Real-estate players have a wide array of options for how to proceed, including low-carbon development and construction; building retrofits to improve energy efficiency; upgrades to heating, cooling, and lighting technology; and technology to manage demand and consumption. But decarbonization is not solely a technical challenge. To develop the most appropriate path, real-estate players need to understand the range of decarbonization options and their financial and strategic costs and benefits.Decarbonizing real estateTo decarbonize, industry players can take the following steps:Understand the starting point. Quantify baseline emissions of each building. This helps real-estate players prioritize where to start (for example, individual buildings, asset classes, or regions) and determine how far there is to go to reach zero emissions.Set targets. Decide which type of decarbonization target to set. There is a range of potential target-setting standards that take different approaches (for example, measuring absolute emissions versus emissions intensity, or setting targets at the sector level versus asset level). Players should develop a “house view” on targets that achieve business, investor, stakeholder, regulatory, and other objectives.Identify decarbonization levers. Build an asset- or portfolio-level abatement curve. A marginal abatement cost curve provides a clear view of the potential cost/return on investment of a given emissions-reduction lever along with the impact of that lever on emissions reduction. This approach can be complemented with market and policy scenarios that change the relative costs and benefits of each potential abatement lever.Execute. Set up the mechanisms to effectively deploy the decarbonization plan. These may involve making changes to financing and governance, stakeholder engagement (investors, joint-venture partners, operators, and tenants), and a range of operational and risk-management aspects of the business.Track and improve. As investors, lenders, and tenants make their own decarbonization commitments, they will need to demonstrate that their real estate is indeed decarbonizing. Thus, much of the value of decarbonizing will come from the ability to demonstrate emissions reduction to potential stakeholders. Building the ability to monitor and progressively reduce emissions on the path to net zero will create an opportunity for players to differentiate.Create new sources of value and revenue streams for investors, tenants, and communitiesAs the economy decarbonizes, real-estate players can use their locations, connections to utility systems, local operational footprints, and climate intelligence to create new revenue streams, improve asset values, or launch entirely new businesses.Opportunities include the following:Local energy generation and storage. Real-estate firms can use their physical presence to generate and store energy. For example, property developers have been outfitting buildings with solar arrays and batteries, helping to stabilize energy grids and reduce the costs associated with clean energy.Green buildings to attract more tenants. Developers and property managers can invest in developing green buildings or retrofitting older buildings to make them green to meet the growing appetite for sustainable workplaces and homes.Green-building materials. Players can explore the advantages of green steel, tall timber, modular construction, and other emerging technologies and materials that may have additional benefits, such as faster and lower-cost construction.Extra services on-site. Firms can introduce new revenue streams, including vehicle charging, green-facilities management, and other on-site services that enable occupants’ sustainable preferences.Services for reducing and tracking emissions. Firms can support occupants by tracking emissions and offering solutions to reduce carbon footprints. These services could include smart sensors and tracking energy consumption through heating, cooling, lighting, and space management.Differentiated capital attraction. Given the volume of capital that has already been committed to achieving net zero, firms that are able to decarbonize will have an advantage in attracting capital. Real-estate players may, for example, create specific funds for net-zero buildings or investment themes that support community-scale decarbonization.The coming climate transition will create seismic shifts in the real-estate industry, changing tenants’ and investors’ demands, the value of individual assets, and the fundamental approaches to developing and operating real estate. Smart players will get ahead of these changes and build climate intelligence early by understanding the implications for asset values, finding opportunities to decarbonize, and creating opportunity through supporting the transition.Real estate not only will play a critical role in determining whether the world successfully decarbonizes but also will continue to reinvent the way we live, work, and play through these profound physical and economic changes."
Business strategy change,https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-announces-independent-consumer-healthcare-company-is-to-be-called-haleon/,GSK announces independent Consumer Healthcare company is to be called Haleon,"For media and investors onlyIssued: London, UKHaleon will be a new world-leader in consumer health with an exceptional portfolio of category-leading brands, including Sensodyne, Voltaren, Panadol and CentrumBusiness is on track to demerge and list as a new company in mid-2022GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) today announced that the new company, to result from the proposed demerger of Consumer Healthcare from GSK in mid-2022, will be called Haleon.Haleon (pronounced ""Hay-Lee-On"") is inspired by the merging of the words Hale, which is an old English word that means in good health and Leon, which is associated with the word strength. The new brand identity was developed with input from employees, healthcare practitioners and consumers and will be deployed in more than 100 markets around the world where the business operates.The creation of Haleon results from a series of successful investments and strategic changes to GSK’s consumer health business over the last 8 years, including integrations of the consumer product portfolios from Novartis and Pfizer. It is now a highly valuable and focused global business generating annual sales of approximately £10 billion[1].As a standalone company, Haleon will be a new world-leader in consumer healthcare, offering a compelling proposition – to bring deep human understanding together with trusted science – to deliver better everyday health with humanity.Brian McNamara, Chief Executive Officer Designate, Haleon, said: “Introducing Haleon to the world marks another step in our journey to become a new, standalone company.
