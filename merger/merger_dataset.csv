"July 12 (Reuters) - Entertainment firm Falcon's Beyond has agreed to go public through a merger with blank-check vehicle in a deal valuing the combined entity at about $1 billion, including debt, the companies said on Tuesday.",1
"The deal with Fast Acquisition Corp. II (FZT.N) is expected to fetch up to $282 million in gross proceeds, assuming no redemptions, including a private placement of $60 million from Falcon's existing investor Katmandu Collections LLLP.",1
"Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), once Wall Street's hottest trend when they peaked during 2020 and early 2021, currently find themselves facing regulatory hurdles and investor distrust amid volatile capital markets and poor share performance of popular firms.",1
"SPACs are publicly listed companies raised with the intention of merging with a private company, which goes public through the merger and is seen as an alternative to an IPO.",1
"Discovery became the second major Spirit shareholder to publicly back a merger with JetBlue, which is vying with Frontier to expand in the United States and create the country's fifth-largest airline.",1
Discovery owns 1.4% of Spirit.,0
"Last month, Spirit shareholder TIG Advisors LLC also informed the carrier's board of directors that it intends to vote against Frontier's bid with the low-cost carrier.",1
"However, Frontier on Monday declined to further raise its bid for Spirit, potentially drawing the curtains on its months-long bidding war with JetBlue.",1
"JetBlue's latest cash-and-stock bid values Spirit at $3.7 billion, while Frontier's latest cash-and-stock bid, which Spirit recommends its shareholders should back, is worth $2.4 billion.",1
Spirit has delayed its shareholder vote on the deal for a third time to July 15 to negotiate further with both suitors.,1
JetBlue says a tie-up with Spirit will deliver synergies of $600 million to $700 million the first year after integration is complete.,1
"Airline experts said the long-term synergies cited by both JetBlue and Frontier make it worth the price the companies are willing to pay for Spirit, although some analysts cautioned that the bidding war might strain their finances in the near term.",1
"Two months later, JetBlue swooped in with an all-cash, unsolicited bid worth $3.6 billion for Spirit that was higher than the price Frontier had offered.",1
"Since then, both sides have engaged in a game of one-upmanship and made competing offers for Spirit that have included sweeteners such as higher break-up fees and route divestitures, which were aimed at easing regulatory concerns.",1
"Frontier, which has so far been unable to garner enough shareholder support for its proposal, earlier on Monday urged Spirit to extend the shareholder voting deadline to July 27, saying its last proposal was its ""best and final offer"" and that it was waiving its right to match JetBlue's most recent offer.",1
"The airline industry is grappling with high fuel prices, pilot shortages and flight cancellations as it tackles a rebound in travel demand more than two years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
A tie-up with Spirit would give the winning suitor more scale and resources to deal with these challenges.,1
Raymond James & Associates airlines analyst Savanthi Syth said the deal made sense long-term even though it was expensive.,1
"""This is a more expensive deal, at 17 times price-to-earnings, than the deal for Virgin America at 15.5 times,"" Syth said, referring to the bidding war in 2016 between Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK.N) and JetBlue that ended with Alaska buying Virgin America in a $2.6 billion deal.",1
Alaska made its deal work.,1
"Since taking over Virgin America, it has won market share against low-cost competitors and paid down debt it raised to finance the acquisition, analysts said.",1
It will be assuming $3.5 billion of new debt to finance its bid for Spirit.,1
"""Recessions are always very tricky environments for airlines,"" said Florian Ederer, associate professor of economics at the Yale School of Management.",0
Frontier will not be stretching itself as much.,0
Frontier has an advantage in that its bid is seen by Spirit as more likely to be cleared by antitrust regulators than a tie-up with JetBlue.,1
"JetBlue's current Northeast Alliance with American Airlines is already in the crosshairs of the regulators - in June, a U.S. judge said the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and JetBlue would move forward.",1
"Spirit has, so far, said that a deal is not possible unless JetBlue drops that partnership.",1
"William Ackman, founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, May 4, 2015.",0
"In a letter sent to shareholders on Monday, Ackman highlighted numerous factors, including adverse market conditions and strong competition from traditional initial public offerings (IPOs), that thwarted his efforts to find a suitable company to merge his SPAC with.",1
"SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, are publicly-listed shells of cash that are created by large investors - known as sponsors - for the sole purpose of merging with a private company.",1
"The process, which is similar to a reverse merger, takes the target company public.",1
"SPACs peaked during 2020 and the early part of 2021, helping rake in paper gains worth hundreds of millions of dollars for a number of prominent SPAC creators like Michael Klein and Chamath Palihapitiya.",0
"However, over the past year, companies that merged with SPACs have performed poorly, forcing investors to shun blank-check deals.",1
"Moreover, the record-breaking performance of regular IPOs in the United States in 2021 posed competitive challenges for SPAC sponsors like Ackman, as several richly valued startups chose to list their shares on exchanges through traditional routes instead.",0
"In July last year, Ackman's efforts to take a 10% stake in Universal Music, which was being spun off by French media conglomerate Vivendi, through his SPAC were derailed due to regulatory hurdles.",1

"After the deal closes, Potash shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company, while Agrium’s investors will own 48 percent.",1
"The combination would help Potash, which produces half the potash in North America, reduce its exposure to volatile prices for the potassium product.",1
"Agrium has a big presence among farm-retail chains, enabling it to produce more stable earnings than wholesale fertilizer, according to a Sept. 1 report by Fitch Ratings after word of preliminary talks between the two companies came out.",1
"A combination “will improve market reach and allow the company to optimize its product margins,” Monica Bonar, a senior director at Fitch, said in the report.",1
"The deal follows others that involve the farming industry, including the pending merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont to create a company that would eventually break into three parts, one of which would focus on agricultural chemicals.",1
"In addition, China National Chemical Corporation, or ChemChina, has agreed to acquire seed and farm chemicals producer Syngenta.",1
"And the German industrial giant Bayer has been in back-and-forth negotiations with Monsanto, the American company known for its genetically modified crop seeds.",1
Some farm groups have raised concerns about the effect of a merger of Agrium and Potash on fertilizer prices.,1
Yet there has been little public outcry since the two companies said on Aug. 30 that they were in talks.,1
"The timing of the move underscores the sudden cooling in investor sentiment towards speculative technology firms as the Ukraine war and supply chain problems push up inflation and interest rates, eroding consumer purchasing power.",0
"In a June 22 trading update about a sell-off in tech stocks, Zip had said it was putting up fees and reviewing global operations outside the U.S., but that ""the acquisition of Sezzle remains on track"".",1
"On Tuesday, however, the deal was off, with immediate effect, the companies said.",1
"""What changed since ZIP's announcement ... where the company stated that the transaction remained on track?""",1
"Zip had issued new shares to raise capital when it announced the Sezzle buyout, Chen said, adding, ""This could cause some discontent amongst investors who participated.""",1
"Sezzle's biggest shareholder is Youakim, with a stake of 44%, Refinitiv data shows.",0
"When the Sydney-listed firms unveiled the all-stock deal in February, they said it valued Sezzle at about A$491 million ($330 million), based on Zip's share price.",1
"Zip shares bounced as much as 13% by mid-session, ahead of a broader market (.AXJO) advance of 0.3%, but are still down about 90% since the start of the year.",0
"But it also slowed the scaling of Zip's U.S. business, in which transaction frequency concerns persist, he added.",0

"The company has had two major mergers with European automakers in a little more than a decade — first, a failed 1998 marriage with German automaker Daimler, and then a somewhat more harmonious 2009 union with Italy’s Fiat, turning it into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, or FCA.",1
"Now, the company is planning to go to the altar for a third time, with French manufacturer Groupe PSA, best known for its Peugeot brand.",1
Industry experts warn that mergers are always a challenge.,1
"As in the case of Daimler, a cultural mismatch between two companies can cause friction, and worse.",0
"However, experts say that a super-sized FCA-PSA that pools the resources and strengths of the two automakers may be better able to invest in new technologies and compete globally.",1
Here’s why experts say a merger may be just what Fiat Chrysler and PSA both need.,1
"Coming together could make the automakers innovate more efficiently, he says, as they can pool development resources and share designs.",1
Gordon admits that there’s an open debate as to whether mergers actually lead to innovation.,1
"In part, that’s because companies tend to spend money elsewhere after a tie-up.",1
"However, he argues that mergers also offer companies cover to nix ideas that aren’t working out.",1
"“When you do a merger, everything is looked at,” says Gordon.",1
"In 2017, it purchased two struggling car brands — Opel and Vauxhall — from General Motors.",1
"Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for Autotrader, says that such massive size could be a big advantage as it plans for the future.",0
The merger may also help them to move into another market where neither company has much of a presence: China.,1
"“As a global automaker, you can’t ignore China.",0
“It’s also the largest market for electric vehicles.,0
Dow Chemical and DuPont announced a merger that would fuse two stalwarts of American industry into a giant worth more than $120 billion and would reshape the chemical and agricultural industries.,1
"The combined company would have about $90 billion in total revenue, based on 2014 numbers, and products ranging from corn seeds to Kevlar fiber to foam chemicals used in sneaker soles.",1
That behemoth would serve as a vehicle for cutting some $3 billion in costs before splitting into three separate businesses 18 to 24 months after the merger closes.,1
"The Justice Department on Friday approved the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies in the United States, saying its antitrust concerns had been addressed and giving its blessing to a deal that would reshape the nation’s wireless industry.",1
"Critics of the merger have said it would reduce competition by lowering the number of wireless carriers from four to three, resulting in higher cellphone bills.",1
"On Friday, those critics, a group that includes attorneys general from several states and Democratic presidential candidates, continued to voice their objections to the deal, saying the combination would harm consumers.",1
"In a news briefing on Friday, Makan Delrahim, the Trump administration’s top antitrust regulator, said the agency had only decided to approve the deal after T-Mobile and Sprint agreed last week to sell off significant portions of their businesses to the pay-television operator Dish Network as part of a plan to create a potential new major wireless company.",1
"Under the agreement’s terms, Mr. Delrahim said, “Dish is in a unique position to succeed.”",0
"United Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed Sunday to a $3 billion merger that would create the world’s biggest airline, according to people briefed on the negotiations.",1
"The deal, to be announced officially on Monday, would form a coast-to-coast behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, along with an extended network to Asia, Latin America and Europe.",1
"The deal was completed in a remarkably swift three weeks, and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low-cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad.",1
"United is buying Continental, and the combined company will keep the United name and be based in Chicago.",1
"If the deal wins antitrust approval, the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier.",1
The merger gives Denver-based Frontier Airlines a 51.5% controlling stake in the combined airline.,1
"Spirit investors will receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each share they own, giving Spirit shareholders an implied value of $25.83 per share, which is a 19% premium over the value of Spirit shares at the end of last week, the companies said.",1
"""The transaction is centered around creating an aggressive low-fare competitor that will better serve guests, expand career opportunities for our team members and create value for our shareholders,"" Ted Christie, CEO of Miramar, Fla.-based Spirit, told analysts on a call discussing the deal on Monday.",1
"""We believe we are a perfect fit with Frontier.",1
The boards of both companies approved the deal over the weekend.,1
"It would be the first merger of large U.S. airlines since Alaska Airlines' combination with Virgin America in 2016 and a test of the Biden administration's tolerance for consolidation, particularly among airlines, one of the most scrutinized industries by antitrust regulators.",1
"Spirit's shares soared more than 17% after the deal was announced, closing at $25.46, while Frontier's ended the day $12.82 up 3.5%.",1
"Frontier Chairman Bill Franke, a longtime discount airline investor and executive, will chair the combined company, which he said ""will create America's most competitive ultra-low fare airline for the benefit of consumers.""",1
"The companies didn't announce the new name of the combined carrier, the CEO or location of the airline's headquarters.",1
"Those questions will be answered by a committee led by Franke after the transaction closes, which is expected in the second half of the year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.",1
"Pilots at Frontier and Spirit are represented by the same union, as are the two airlines' flight attendants.",0
"That has meant U.S. airlines large and small have been going after domestic leisure travelers, redrawing their networks in the process, to help dig themselves out of pandemic losses.",0
"Shortly after that move, Indigo bought Frontier Airlines from Republic Airways for $145 million.",1
Spirit Airlines aircraft are seen parked at the end of a runway at Orlando International Airport on the sixth day the airline has cancelled hundreds of flights.,0
"Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit has also been aggressively expanding in the last decade, including in much larger rivals' hubs, and plans to continue that strategy once it combines with Frontier.",1
"The two airlines had been having deal talks ""in earnest"" since late last year, Christie said.",1
"""Spirit is very strong in the East.",0
"Frontier said it doesn't expect there to be any furloughs and told its flight attendants that it anticipates ""maintaining all of our current bases and growing them over time.""",0

"Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad.",1
"Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said that inversions were “wrong,” and that he would try and restrict them.",0
"The Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace.",1
Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.,0
"Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.",1
"Founded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals.",0
"In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills.",0
"After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine.",0
"These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction).",0
Pfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research.,0
"As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.",0
But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails.,0
"(Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is distinctly dodgy.)",0
"Read, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergan, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States.",1
"For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health.",0
"Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.",0
"All things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity.",1
"If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through.",1
"Other non-executives on the Pfizer board include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital.",0

Bayer said it expects to complete the merger by midsummer.,1
"“Receipt of the DOJ’s approval brings us close to our goal of creating a leading company in agriculture,” Bayer chief executive Werner Baumann said in a statement.",1
"U.S. antitrust officials investigated the Bayer-Monsanto deal for more than a year, ultimately concluding that it could result in increased costs for the country’s agricultural sector.",1

"To address those concerns, the Justice Department will require Bayer to transfer several research facilities and projects to BASF, including a research center in North Carolina and a bank of soybean tissue samples used to develop new products.",1

"""The merger combines two world class assets, both in Tier-1 mining jurisdictions, into a single group with scale and know-how,"" he said.",1
"The merger de-risks and underpins the path to development at Mulga Rock, Vimy Managing Director and CEO Steven Michael said.",1
"""The combined financial, processing and operating strengths of both companies will enable greater optimisation and the delivery of Mulga Rock, as well as an established exploration team that can unlock considerable value at Alligator River,"" he added, as well as ""expected significant benefits of being part of a larger, geographically diverse merged group, with the expertise to develop the full portfolio of assets in the near term.""",1

The AT&T-Time Warner Merger: What Are The Pros And Cons For Consumers?,1
"The news of this transformational merger has shaken up both industries, raising eyebrows on Wall Street and drawing criticism from lawmakers and even the presidential campaigns.",1
"The deal is expected to face stringent scrutiny from regulators: the Department of Justice, which considers antitrust laws, and potentially also the Federal Communications Commission, which broadly weighs whether deals are in the public interest.",1
The companies underscore that their deal would combine two entities that don't directly compete in a so-called vertical merger.,1
"AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier, one of the top broadband providers and — thanks to its recent purchase of DirecTV — also a major pay-TV provider.",1
"Time Warner (not to be confused with Time Warner Cable, which was recently bought by Charter Communications) is a massive media and entertainment conglomerate, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Bros. studio and other assets.",1
"A merger of two noncompeting companies — a content distributor and a content supplier — may not face a public interest test, says New Street Research analyst Vivek Stalam.",1
But that's the top question on many consumers' minds: What does this merger mean for me?,1
Below are some of the proposed deal's pros and cons.,1
"CEO Randall Stephenson says the company's customers are demanding ""more and more premium content"" for their mobile devices — and they want it created, formatted and curated in a way specifically set up for mobility.",0
"If you want a package of more channels, fewer channels, you want it mobile, you want it in your house across all your screens,"" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told CNBC.",0
"""There are no clear harms from this deal.""",1
And that's a major argument of the companies.,0
"There is not one bit of media consolidation,"" Stephenson tells NPR's Folkenflik.",0
"""This is a vertical merger; it is not a horizontal merger.",1
The companies' competitors and consumer interest groups are worried that AT&T would use Time Warner's programming as a bargaining chip.,1
"""DirecTV, for instance, might favor Time Warner content, crowding out or refusing to carry alternative and independent programming that viewers might prefer,"" advocacy group Public Knowledge has argued, also positing that AT&T might try to toy with prices to drive customers to its platforms or exclude Time Warner content from data caps on its broadband networks.",0
"Historically, consolidation does not tend to lower costs for consumers, partially because that's not something regulators typically can prescribe as they place conditions on deals.",1
"""The sorry history of megamergers shows they run roughshod over the public interest,"" says former FCC commissioner and now consumer interest advocate Michael Copps.",1
"""Further entrenching monopoly harms innovation and drives up prices for consumers.""",0
The Department of Justice announced today that Visa Inc. and Plaid Inc. have abandoned their planned $5.3 billion merger.,1
"The department filed a civil antitrust lawsuit on Nov. 5, 2020, to stop the merger, alleging that Visa is a monopolist in online debit, charging consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments.",1
"The case was scheduled for trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on June 28, 2021.",0
"As a result of Visa and Plaid’s decision to terminate their merger agreement, the United States has filed a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal.",1
"Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visa’s online debit services.",1
Visa is a global payments company that operates the largest debit network in the United States.,0
Plaid is a financial services company that operates the leading financial data aggregation platform in the United States.,0
The video game industry is in the middle of a gold rush of acquisitions.,1
"The reverse is also true, with companies exploring the possibility of being acquired, too.",1
"The latest example may come as a shock, however.",0
"A new report indicates Electronic Arts has been actively pursuing a sale or merger, and even came surprisingly close before the deal fell through.",1
"The report comes from outlet Puck, which claims that Electronic Arts is having conversations with some of the tech industry's largest companies regarding the possibility of a sale or merger.",1
"As an explanation, the report says that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard ""emboldened"" the company to seek out possible partners to purchase it.",1
The deal would have involved Comcast-NBCUniversal spinning off the NBCUniversal media portion of the company to merge with Electronic Arts.,1
"Comcast CEO Brian Roberts' family would take majority control of the new company, while EA CEO Andrew Wilson would stay on to run the company.",1
The deal is said to have fallen through relatively recently over price and corporate structure post-merger.,1
A merger between Electronic Arts and another company is said to be its preference over an outright acquisition.,1
It's also said that EA is trying to ensure that Wilson is retained as the company's CEO following the merger.,1
It's said to be facing possible acquisition efforts from other private equity firms.,1
"While the report doesn't clarify, it can likely be assumed that Electronic Arts will continue to explore the possibility of being acquired or merging with another company going forward.",1
"As strange as it may seem that EA could be acquired, few could have foreseen Microsoft picking up Activision Blizzard, too.",1
Officials from Public Service Company of New Mexico and Avangrid say a pending merger would help the state’s largest electric utility reach renewable energy targets at a faster pace.,1
The two companies hosted a press conference on Thursday following the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission’s discussion the previous day regarding a hearing examiner’s recommendation that the commission deny the merger.,1
Three of the five commissioners stated during the Wednesday meeting that they oppose the merger and believe that the potential harms to the customers outweigh the benefits.,1
"During Thursday’s press conference, Balderas also spoke about the importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels and said that the merger could help New Mexico achieve the goals set out in the 2019 Energy Transition Act.",1
"Even if the merger is rejected, Vincent-Collawn said PNM remains committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels, as required by the Energy Transition Act, though it will take a bit longer.",1
This comes as Avangrid has faced opposition in Maine where customers and state officials say reliability has decreased and rates have increased following Avangrid’s acquisition of Central Maine Power.,1
"It also comes amid an investigation in Spain involving Avangrid’s parent company, Iberdrola, and corporate espionage.",0
"Pedro Azagra Blázquez, Iberdrola’s corporate development director, also said that the investigation in Spain is ongoing and that it has not yet yielded any indictments or charges or determinations of wrongdoing.",0
"The officials also said that, if the merger is approved, the company would be required to pay fines if it did not meet reliability requirements and that any rate increase would require PRC approval.",1
"While the hearing examiner has recommended the commission vote to reject the merger, he provided a list of recommended conditions for the commission to include should it choose to approve the merger.",1
She said the merger of the two companies provides a better credit rating for PNM as it looks to develop electric vehicle charging networks and to transition away from fossil fuels.,1
Later she compared it to shopping at Costco and said if you buy in bulk you are able to save money.,0
Azagra Blázquez said the merger also moves $1 billion of PNM’s debt out of New Mexico and will provide opportunities for economic development in the state.,1
"Should the merger be rejected, he said Avangrid and Iberdrola would not consider New Mexico as a place to locate certain resources and activities.",1
"If the merger is approved, on the other hand, he said Avangrid would base operations out of New Mexico on a national scale.",1
He also said that Avangrid would help New Mexico develop a hydrogen industry.,0
This project’s budget is about $2.6 billion.,0
"He said Moody’s, a credit rating agency, downgraded Avangrid’s score due to Avangrid Renewables’ investments in non-utility projects.",0
“Avangrid states that it wants to use its acquisition of PNM as a beachhead for Avangrid Renewables’ projects in New Mexico and the Southwest.,1
"The resource needs of Avangrid Renewables may take priority over PNM needs for resources to provide reliable utility service to its customers,” he said.",0
"Schannauer also said the merger could result in rigged bidding processes and that PNM would favor using Avangrid-owned renewable resources over those developed by other companies, thus increasing the electricity costs that customers would pay.",1
The vast majority of public input has urged the PRC to reject the merger.,1
Commissioner Cynthia Hall said she has received hundreds of communications with members of the public opposing the merger.,1
"At the start of the PRC meeting, many of the public commenters, including people from Maine who are current Avangrid customers, asked the commissioners to reject the merger.",1
"It would be best if these profits stayed within New Mexico,” he said.",0
"Jim DesJardins, the executive director of Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico, said there have been complaints that Central Maine Power under Avangrid improperly increased the costs that renewable energy developers had to pay to connect to the grid.",1
Net metering allows customers who have solar panels at their house or business to sell excess power produced back to the company.,0
"“Our organization has not taken a position either way on the merger,” DesJardins said.",1
"“We do urge that if the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approves the merger, that there’ll be a commitment from the merged companies that net metering is preserved in a fair treatment for small generators in New Mexico.",1
"Despite the fact that three commissioners have voiced opposition to the merger, Vincent-Collawn said PNM trusts the regulatory process.",1
"Schannauer acknowledged that the benefits proposed in the merger stipulation–including investments in economic development, job creation and assistance for low-income customers–are greater than those seen in other merger cases that the PRC has granted.",1
"However, he said those previous cases did not have the potential harms to customers that the Avangrid and PNM merger case has.",1
"“The benefits are not meaningful if PNM customers do not have reliable service,” he said.",0
"LONDON — Essilor of France said on Monday that it would merge with the Luxottica Group of Italy, owner of the Ray-Ban and Oakley brands, in a $49 billion deal that would create a giant in the eyewear industry.",1

"Exxon Mobil and Chevron the two largest oil companies in the U.S., discussed a megamerger last year that would leave the country with just one oil giant for the first time in decades, according to The Wall Street Journal.",1

"Jeb Bush , Evolv is merging with the SPAC NewHold Investment",1
"BuzzFeed and Vox Media were both valued at $1 billion or more six years ago, based on investments of about $200 million each from NBCUniversal, the parent company of MSNBC and NBC News.",0
"In the absence of well-heeled suitors, some of the most influential and successful companies in the digital media industry have instead pivoted to a strategy of consolidation, buying up and merging with onetime competitors.",1
"With a larger total audience, those companies can make more money from corporate advertisers and are better positioned to compete with tech giants such as Facebook and Google — or so the thinking goes.",0
"The deal was made in exchange for stock in the combined company, not cash, said Vox Media chief executive and co-founder Jim Bankoff, who will run the expanded entity.",1
"“The acquisition of Group Nine will contribute to making us an even stronger company collectively, and that is what we and our board of directors determined is the best path forward for all of our stakeholders,” he said in an interview.",1
"Specifically, Bankoff said the deal will provide more financial resources for the company to invest in editorial products such as the general interest news site Vox.com, tech news site The Verge, sports news site SB Nation, and now the media websites that make up Group Nine Media, including travel lifestyle brand Thrillist, news-focused site NowThis and the Dodo, which publishes cute and educational content about animals.",1
"This is about growth.” (Lerer will serve on the board of the expanded Vox Media and will be “really available for anything and everything” that company leadership needs, he said).",0
"Asked why Group Nine Media chose a merger rather than a sale to a larger company, Lerer said he looked around and chose the best long-term option.",1
“We weren’t running a sale process and Vox made the best bid.,0
Both companies had already grown through acquisition.,1
Vox Media purchased New York magazine and its digital properties in 2019.,1
"Group Nine Media, which was formed in 2016 with substantial funding from Discovery Communications, acquired PopSugar in 2019.",1
"As part of that process, the company recently acquired youth entertainment company Complex Networks for $200 million, plus $100 million in company stock.",1
"BuzzFeed had already grown bigger by acquiring the HuffPost website in November 2020, which has changed hands multiple times since it was first sold to AOL in 2011.",1
The company says that it is too early to draw any major conclusions from just over one week of trading — either about BuzzFeed’s value or about the broader strength of the digital media industry.,0
"Vice Media, which acquired the women-focused lifestyle brand Refinery29 in 2019, has not gone public and has not made any further major transactions but has continued to raise gobs of money from investors.",1
"“We thought about consolidation and decided it’s easier in this environment to grow on our own,” he said, citing positive trends in the advertising and subscription business.",1
(Axios reportedly held talks with Axel Springer about a possible sale earlier in the year.),1
"For now, Vox Media is focused on completing its merger with Group Nine, a deal that is expected to close in the first few months of 2022.",1
But Bankoff has not ruled out going public — like BuzzFeed — in the future.,0
Vox Media’s chief executive indirectly referenced that possibility when he wrote about integrating functions at the two companies in an email sent to employees on Monday afternoon.,1

"and the Justice Department are likely to look for ways to have an impact without being subject to judicial review, Mr. Melamed said, and one way to do that is by challenging mergers in general, whether or not a case has a good chance of winning.",1
"“The risk and time delays of a merger challenge often cause the parties to abandon a deal even if the government’s case is weak,” he said.",1
"The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, will see Telenor and CP Group each owning a third of the combined company, with stock market investors holding the rest.",1
The partnership will arm the two companies better against current market leader Advanced Info Service Pcl (AIS) (ADVANC.BK) and give them deeper pockets to face mounting investment costs for 5G.,1
"The news comes months after Thai power producer Gulf Energy Development (GULF.BK) offered to buy Intouch Holdings (INTUCH.BK), which controls AIS, though Gulf Energy has only managed to raise its stake in Intouch to 42.3% so far.",1
"Telenor and CP Group's merged company will have ""revenue market share in the low 40% that is similar to AIS,"" Brekke told media.",1
"The tie-up between True and Dtac is set to become the third biggest merger deal between Thai companies, according to Refinitiv data.",1
The combined firm will be listed on the Thai stock exchange.,1
"Telenor believes regulators will view the deal favourably, Chief Financial Officer Tone Hegland Bachke told a conference call.",1
The offer of 47.76 baht ($1.45) per Dtac share represents a premium of 15.8% to its Friday close and the offer of 5.09 baht ($0.1549) per True Corp share represents a premium of 17.8% to its close on the same day.,1

"TiVo is combining with Xperi — a licensing firm that specializes in semiconductor technology as well as various A/V brands — in a $3 billion merger, the two companies announced today.",1
The deal marks the end of an era for the iconic DVR company.,1
"The original TiVo company was bought back in 2016 by Rovi for $1.1 billion, primarily for TiVo’s huge (and profitable) stash of patents.",1
"Rovi would go on to change its name to TiVo post-acquisition, and the combined company, which still makes most of its money through patent licensing, is now merging with California-based Xperi.",1
"The Rovi-owned TiVo had previously been exploring a split into two separate companies earlier this year, dividing the once-popular product department from the less consumer-facing but lucrative patent licensing half.",1
"That plan has been scrapped, though, due to the Xperi merger.",1
"TiVo is best known for its pioneering DVR set-top boxes, which the company still produces today, albeit with far less popularity than it once commanded in the marketplace.",0
But it’s going to make my CES briefings a lot more interesting.,0
"It’s a similar arrangement to that of audio technology brand DTS, which Xperi acquired back in 2016.",1
"As Xperi’s press release announcing the merger proudly boasts, “With 10,000 patents and applications between the two companies and minimal licensee overlap, the combined IP business will be one of the largest licensing companies in the world.”",1
"A federal judge on Tuesday blocked a $6.3 billion proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot, dashing another huge deal and handing the Obama administration one more antitrust victory.",1

"Group Nine had held previous discussions with Vox Media and other companies about a merger through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that it had created with the intention of going public.",1
The terms were not disclosed.,0
"The new Vox Media would be among the largest media companies in the United States, with about 2,000 employees, Mr. Bankoff said, adding that Group Nine’s websites complemented Vox Media’s, adding that the Group Nine audience was younger.",1
"“Vox Media is, for instance, extraordinary at podcasting and has a big presence across our websites.” Both companies, he said, have robust studio divisions: “I don’t think there is a major premium streaming service that we’re not in business with.”",0

"Prices for both are up around 50% in 2021, striking multi-year highs as demand recovers from a pandemic-driven dip, while power curbs on Chinese industry and disruption to ore supply from Myanmar have constrained production.",0

"After years of on-again, off-again merger talks, broadcast giant CBS Corp. and its corporate sibling Viacom Inc. on Tuesday finally agreed to reunite in a nearly $12-billion deal that will bring together such well-known brands as CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Showtime.",1
"CBS, which is the larger of the two companies and worth $18.5 billion, will absorb the smaller Viacom, which owns such assets as BET, Comedy Central and the Paramount Pictures movie studio in Hollywood.",1
"The new company will be called ViacomCBS Inc., in a nod to the legacy of Sumner Redstone, the ailing 96-year-old media titan who built an empire from a small chain of drive-in movie theaters in the Northeast.",1
"Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish will become president and chief executive of the new entity, and gain a seat on the board.",1
The proposed merger of the two New York-based companies is the latest in the wave of entertainment industry consolidations and was widely expected.,1
It was the third time in three years that CBS and Viacom attempted to hook up.,1
"Last year, telecommunications colossus AT&T bought HBO, CNN, TBS and the Warner Bros. studio in an $85-billion deal.",1
"In March, Walt Disney Co. completed a $71.3-billion acquisition of much of Rupert Murdoch’s Hollywood holdings.",1
But it wasn’t just a consolidating industry and splintering audiences that drove the two companies together.,1
ViacomCBS will be worth about $30 billion.,1
"Viacom shares closed at $29.21, up 2.4% while CBS shares rose 1.3% to $48.70.",1
The family firm already has approved the all-stock transaction.,1
"Existing CBS shareholders will own 61% of the combined company, while existing Viacom shareholders will own about 39%.",1
Viacom shareholders will receive .59625 shares of CBS stock for every Viacom share that they own.,1
"The new company will be one of the largest players in TV advertising, capturing an estimated 22% of viewership to traditional television.",1
"Combined, the company spends more than $13 billion a year to produce content.",0
"The company also will have international exposure with networks in Britain, Australia and Argentina.",0
"The merger, which was ratified overwhelmingly by the boards of both companies, requires the approval of government regulators, a process that is expected to take several months.",1
The companies said they expect the deal to be complete by year’s end.,1
"The corporate combination, expected to achieve $500 million in savings, will be a homecoming of sorts.",1
"More than a quarter-century later, then-Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone victoriously announced what he called “a merger of equals” between his company and CBS.",1
"In a September 1999 news conference, Redstone told journalists: “Viacom and CBS are natural partners ... we are siblings.” At that time, Wall Street valued a combined Viacom-CBS at $80 billion.",1
The marriage lasted just six years.,0
"Viacom was a darling on Wall Street and Madison Avenue because its networks — Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV — drew younger viewers who were prized by advertisers.",0
"“We have long believed that the initial separation of these companies made zero sense,” media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a recent report.",0
"Viacom’s brass sold its valuable Nickelodeon shows to Netflix, helping the Los Gatos, Calif., company build its audience.",0
"“The studio suffered over $1 billion in losses,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.",0
She installed Bakish as chief executive of Viacom.,1
Bakish overhauled the management of the moribund Paramount film studio and tossed out senior management at the TV channels.,0
"She was rebuffed the first time because CBS’ management, including its former powerful chief executive, Leslie Moonves, and independent board members worried that the battered Viacom would be a drag on CBS.",1
"Then, last year, merger talks collapsed when CBS’ independent board members sued the Redstones in an unsuccessful attempt to strip the family of its controlling votes.",1
"Amid the high-stakes legal fight, CBS became engulfed in a scandal.",0
He denied the allegations but was forced to resign in September.,0
"The controversy led to changes in the CBS board, the appointment of Joseph Ianniello as the acting CEO, and, ultimately, the merger talks that began earlier this year and culminated this week.",1
It was among the first to stream live programming.,0
"The new board will consist of 13 members, including six independent members from CBS, four independent members from Viacom, Bakish and two designees of National Amusements, including Shari Redstone.",1
"Viacom-CBS still will continue to be a relative small fry — unless it combines with other independent studios, such as Sony Pictures Entertainment or a major telecommunications company like Verizon or T-Mobile.",1
"Comcast, which also owns the European television service Sky, is approaching $200 billion.",1
Netflix is valued at $140 billion.,0
"“This consolidation is either about leveraging as many assets as you can to build CBS All Access into a streaming service like Disney+, or by packaging enough channels and library content together so that you can flip the company.”",1
"Nextdoor, a social media app for neighborhoods, announced Tuesday it will go public through a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal valuing the firm at $4.3 billion.",1
"The deal with special purpose acquisition company Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co II includes a private investment of $270 million from Baron Capital Group, accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest.",1
"On ""Squawk on the Street,"" Friar said San Francisco-based Nextdoor will continue expanding into new territories, which in turn generates more content for the platform.",0
"The platform, created in 2011, allows users to organize events, alert neighbors of danger and spread useful information such as business postings or pandemic-related news.",0
"Nextdoor is used in more than 275,000 neighborhoods around the world and in nearly 1-in-3 U.S. households, according to a company press release.",0
"[Nextdoor] has ... not only the strong network effects but very strong local online-offline effects, which are very, very rare,"" Khosla added, while expressing confidence in the company's metrics and future potential growth.",0
"It also reported accelerating average revenue per user, or ARPU, during the first and second quarters this year, Friar added.",0
"The company is also working on other ways to boost revenue, she added, ""particularly around local commerce, local businesses, and really interesting ad formats that you can't get anywhere else.""",0
Friar noted Nextdoor's collaboration with Moderna and Albertsons Companies grocery stores on a map of Covid vaccine locations.,1
"In September 2019, the company was valued at just over $2 billion, TechCrunch reported at the time.",0
Nextdoor's merger with Khosla Ventures' SPAC is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.,1
"In a 2-0 vote, the PUC rejected NextEra Energy's proposed $4.3 billion takeover of Hawaiian Electric Industries in an order issued on Friday, saying the merger was not in the public interest and that the companies failed to demonstrate adequate benefits for residents and a commitment to Hawaii's clean energy goals, among other concerns.",1
"The ruling leaves the door open for future merger applications, saying it it does not mean that the commission is ruling out a change in control of the Hawaiian Electric companies.",1
Regulators also outlined stipulations for any future merger or acquisition proposal.,1
"But nearly two years after the merger was first proposed in December 2014, the rejection represents a turning point for both companies.",1
The PUC's decision comes amid turmoil at the regulatory body over the recent appointment of a new commissioner to replace Michael Champley.,0
"David Ige (D) named Thomas Gorak, chief counsel to the Hawaii PUC, to replace Champley, whose term ended on June 30.",0
"While PUC Chair dismissed the complaint as a ""smear,"" Ige's decision to replace Champley, a supporter of the NextEra-HECO merger, may have tilted the commission's balance just as it was preparing to issue a decision.",1
"From the beginning, NextEra struggled to win support for its merger plan.",1
"Many intervenors worried the merger's approval would raise electricity rates in the state, already the highest in the nation.",1
Concerns over NextEra's track record with renewables at its regulated utility Florida Light & Power caused some stakeholders to argue that the merger would not help Hawaii meet its 100%-renewables-by-2045 mandate.,1
"NextEra promised lower rates after the merger, but most Hawaii residents believed the opposite would be true if the deal went through, according to a February poll by Honolulu Civil Beat.",1
Intervenors were even more skeptical of the deal.,1
"In other utility mergers, like the Exelon-Pepco deal in Washington, companies have won approval from regulators once making changes to their acquistion applications.",1
"NextEra and Hawaiian Electric announced their termination of the deal Monday morning, saying NextEra will pay a $90 million break-up fee and up to $5 million for reimbursement of expenses associated with the transaction.",1
"The PUC left the door open to future merger applications, outlining the conditions upon which the deal could be approved.",1
A statement from the governor's office also suggested the possibility of a future merger.,1
"""This ruling gives us a chance to reset and refocus on our goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2045.",0
"We look forward to creating a process to find the best partner in the world,"" Ige said.",0
"Media reports emerged in the lead-up to the decision that NextEra may have been cooling off its pursuit of the deal, instead eyeing a bid for Texas utility Oncor.",1
"Other reports have suggested possible interest in Hawaiian Electric from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which also just reportedly bid for Oncor.",1
"NextEra already owns Florida Power & Light, the largest regulated electric utility in Florida, and NextEra Energy Resources, one of the biggest renewable developers in the U.S. Hawaiian Electric had previously been described by HEI CEO Connie Lau as NextEra's ""snack"" on the way to a buffet of regulated utilities that it wants to acquire.",1
The acquisition of HEI offered NextEra Energy an intriguing and immeasurable benefit: the opportunity to use Hawaiian Electric as a guinea pig to solve the challenges caused by high levels of renewable and distributed energy resources—well before they hit the mainland.,1
"Those are challenges many utilities are only starting to deal with across the continental U.S., but only Hawaiian Electric—and perhaps California's investor-owned utilities—are experiencing in real-time.",0
"The deal comes at a time when the U.S. electric utility industry has been seeing a lot of merger activity in the last few years, with the broad trend of change driving many of those acquisitions.",1
"“The U.S. is ripe for opportunity, given the massive changes we're seeing in the country.",0
"Hawaii is at the forefront of those changes, often described in the power sector as being a ""postcard from the future.""",0
Rooftop solar penetration in Hawaiian Electric's service territory is already well over 10%—the feared tipping point at which many in the industry believe utilities will start to see truly significant grid integration and business model challenges.,0

Some analysts contend that Spirit and Frontier are better suited to merge because they operate under similar “ultra-low-cost” business models but have more extensive flights in different parts of the United States.,1
A JetBlue-Spirit combination could be more difficult to pull off because the airlines’ business models are quite different.,1

"Comcast announced Friday that its merger agreement with Time Warner Cable and its related transactions agreement with Charter Communications, Inc. have been terminated.",1
"The merger, which would have made the combined entity the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., had garnered a lot of negative attention since it was announced in February of 2014.",1
"There had been indications in the last few days that the deal would find it difficult to get the required regulatory approvals, with staff attorneys at the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division stating that they were nearing a recommendation to block the deal, and the FCC staff recommending a procedural move that would put the merger in jeopardy.",1
"With the dissenting voices increasing, Comcast decided that the best course of action would be to drop the merger plans altogether.",1
It was the potential power that the combined entity would have yielded in the high speed internet market that worried him the most.,1
"Earlier in the year, the FCC changed its definition of broadband Internet by revising the required download speeds to 25 Mbps or faster as opposed to the earlier speed limit of 4 Mbps.",0
Critics of the merger have argued that Comcast could use its considerable power in the broadband market to disrupt online streaming services.,1
"Clearly, Wheeler agreed with this view as he noted that ""the proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation especially given the growing importance of high-speed broadband to online video and innovative new services.""",1
The combined entity would have serviced roughly 30% of the pay-TV market and would have gained significant leverage on the distribution front.,1
"Moreover, the combined entity would have benefited from the merger synergies, especially on the advertising front.",1
The two companies had said that the transaction would generate approximately $1.5 billion in operating synergies.,1
"However, Comcast is not overly dependent on the now-defunct merger for growth.",1
The company has performed well in its high speed internet and pay-TV businesses in the recent past.,0
"Triple play bundling is the combining of the three services offered by Comcast — pay-TV, high speed internet and voice — into one package.",0
"The company's media arm, NBCUniversal grew 7.5% last year and reported revenues in excess of $25 billion.",0
"In the age of big-budget movies, the studio is making money off of movies that are produced at a very reasonable budget.",0
"The studio has also invested in lucrative movie franchises such as The Fast And The Furious, Fifty Shades, Despicable Me, Jurassic Park, etc., which will serve the studio well in the years to come.",0
NBC finished the 2013-14 primetime season as the number one ranked broadcasting network in the coveted 18-49 demographic.,0
Charter Communications has consistently expressed interest in acquiring TWC and Charter?s advisors have reportedly reached out to begin friendly talks on a merger.,1
The company had also made a failed bid for TWC in early 2014.,1
Charter is the fifth largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with just under 4.2 million subscribers and also provides Internet services to more than 5 million subscribers.,0
"Just like the Comcast-TWC deal, Charter's potential merger with TWC would also generate operating efficiencies.",1
"Furthermore, the deal with Charter would face less regulatory scrutiny compared to the Comcast deal, as the potential combined market shares in both the pay-TV and Internet businesses would be smaller.",1
(Read More - Why We Are Revising Our Price Estimate For Time Warner Cable) The subscriber numbers were very positive for the company last year.,0
The company also lost fewer Pay-TV subscribers in 2014 as compared to the previous year.,0

"""We're super excited to bring a high-quality space asset to the market,"" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told CNBC.",0

A SPAC raises money from investors through an initial public offering and then uses the cash to acquire a private company and take it public.,0
"Rocket Lab is among a trend of space companies going public through SPAC deals, with Virgin Galactic the first of the recent generation, in 2019.",0
"Rocket builder Astra, satellite broadband focused AST & Science, satellite data service Spire Global, and space delivery specialist Momentus have each begun trading.",1
"""I don't think it will take long for investors to differentiate between the company that's consistently delivering and the ones that have aspirations to deliver sometime in the future,"" Beck said.",0
Rocket Lab aims to launch Neutron for the first time by 2024.,0

"""It will take time ... really making sure we are getting all communities to participate in research,"" Wojcicki said in an interview with CNBC's ""TechCheck"" on Thursday morning.",0
"It faced FDA scrutiny earlier in its history; continues to face questions about consumer privacy as it gathers genetic information on millions of individuals; ran into financial challenges in recent years as the market for personalized genetic tests seemed to get saturated; skepticism over the basis for its gene-based risk analysis remains contentious; and as it dives deeper into drug development, a gap in its current customer base and underlying genetic data between a majority European genetic profile and underrepresentation of many minority and ethnic groups.",0
"Founded by Anne Wojcicki — the former spouse of Google founder Sergey Brin, who was an early investor in the company — 23andMe was created 15 years ago.",0
"Its at-home testing kits, which allowed people to learn about their genetic profiles and ancestry by sending a bit of saliva through the mail, ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, though not without controversy.",0
"Personalized medicine and at-home genetic testing kit company 23andMe went public on Thursday through a merger with a Richard Branson SPAC, VG Acquisition Corp., in a deal that raised near-$600 million and valued the company at $3.5 billion.",1
Wojcicki says the company sees big things ahead for both its consumer and drug research & development platforms.,0
"""Our genetics represent all of life on this planet, and we have the opportunity to understand what it means and with that, it will improve your own life but also contribute to all kinds of research discoveries,"" Wojcicki said.",0
Some individuals with higher risk of blood clots make the decision to walk around more during plane flights as a result of their 23andMe reports.,0
"Her own 10-year-old son used the company's lactose intolerance analysis to diagnose his stomach aches and Wojcicki herself, while reticent to discuss her personal use of the product, did say as the daughter of a woman who suffered from breast cancer and who has a higher risk of the disease, the information does influence her decision on having that ""recreational glass of wine.""",0
23andMe has 40 programs underway on its drug discovery platform.,0
The company also recently launched a subscription product to introduce more content and services for consumers who want to take additional steps after their genetic reports.,0

"The company announced the merger with New York investment firm Apollo Global Management on Monday, a move that Athene CEO James Belardi told investors will create ""a financial juggernaut.""",1
"Executives for both companies said they hope the deal will make investors more confident, driving up share prices.",1
"It will buy out the outstanding shares at an agreed-upon price, subject to approval from Athene's other shareholders.",1
The companies expect to complete the merger in January 2022.,1
"That, despite the fact that the company's holdings have grown significantly by acquiring businesses from other companies like Voya Financial.",1
"Athene's net income more than doubled, from $805 million in 2016 to $1.92 billion last year.",0
"According to LIMRA, a financial services research agency, Athene sold the 10th-most annuities in the United States in 2020.",0
"Athene profits by investing the up-front payments, betting it will earn more than it needs to pay out and can keep the ""spread.""",0
"""This helps us generate more spread than others.""",0
Executives for both companies hope that the merger will create a stock price that's greater than the current combined value of Apollo and Athene.,1
"In part, that's because financial companies that earn money on a spread aren't as consistent as those that make money by charging fees for their services.",0

"But for T-Mobile, one hurdle remained: Its deal needed approval from the Trump administration.",1
The executives had scheduled stays of up to three days.,0
"These visits highlight a stark reality in Washington, unprecedented in modern American history.",0
"Such visits raise questions about whether patronizing Trump’s private business is viewed as a way to influence public policy, critics said.",0
"In an impromptu interview, the T-Mobile chief executive said he was not seeking special treatment.",0
"He also praised the hotel’s location, next to one of the departments that must approve the company’s merger.",1
"“At the moment I am in town for some meetings at the Department of Justice,” Legere said.",0
"The VIP Arrivals lists obtained by The Post — in which Trump hotel executives alerted their staff to foreign officials, corporate executives, long-term guests, Trump family friends and big spenders — provide an inside look at some of the hotel’s customers.",0
"After Legere’s brief interview at the Trump hotel, T-Mobile declined to comment further for this report.",0
But the T-Mobile case stands out because the company’s executives were expected at the hotel so soon after announcing they needed a win in Washington.,0
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.,0
"In 2011 and in 2014, the Bellevue, Wash.-based company planned to combine with rivals — first AT&T, then Sprint.",1
"Both times, the Obama administration rejected the mergers on antitrust grounds, saying they would decrease competition and hurt consumers.",1
"On April 29, 2018, T-Mobile announced it would try again with Sprint.",1
"The deal would require approval from agencies including the Justice Department, which handles antitrust enforcement, and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the airwaves that cellphones use.",1
"Sprint, the market’s fourth-place player, is largely owned by SoftBank, a Japanese company whose founder, Masayoshi Son, has built his own relationship with Donald Trump.",0
"“I am so happy to wake up in a hotel where every single item isn’t labeled ‘Trump,’ ” he wrote, according to news coverage.",0
"Three years later, on the day after the Sprint merger was announced, Legere was scheduled to arrive at the Trump hotel in Washington.",1
There were executives at a Defense Department contractor called AxleTech; a spokesman said they chose the hotel because they had a meeting at a corporate office across the street.,0
"Of them, only Legere was listed with an “R” next to his name — signaling to Trump hotel employees that he was a repeat Trump customer.",0
"He spotted Legere by his outfit, which was — as usual — a walking billboard for T-Mobile.",0
"“He wasn’t dressed appropriately,” Loft said.",0
"“He was like, ‘If you guys switch, you’ll get 40 percent off for the rest of your life.’ ” T-Mobile did not respond to a query asking whether that offer was legitimate.",0
By that time — six weeks after the merger was announced — the list shows that the T-Mobile executives were already experienced Trump customers.,1
Legere and Carey were members of the “Trump Card” program.,0
He has held two book parties there and often appears in social media photos mingling in the lobby.,0
"Since Trump was elected, his hotel has been patronized by other groups with lobbying interests in Washington: foreign embassies, industry associations, religious groups.",0

Transaction to result in Kalera becoming a publicly listed company on NASDAQ and delisting from Euronext Growth Oslo exchange during Q2 2022.,1

"Based on the common stock of Agrico Acquisition Corp. (“Agrico”) at $10 per share, the transaction implies an exchange ratio of 0.091 for existing Kalera shareholders.",1
"In addition to shares of Agrico common stock, Kalera shareholders will receive one contractual Contingent Value Right per share of common stock that will entitle them to receive up to two stock payments upon the achievement of certain milestones.",0

The proposed merger with Agrico brings the necessary capital for Kalera to be the first leafy green vertical farm company to have a national footprint in the US and be able to reliably supply a national off-take contract while still being local.,1
"With four facilities operating and six more under construction, the company believes that the team is well on the path to achieving this vision.",0
"The share exchange ratio implies a pro forma equity valuation of the combined company of $375 million on a fully diluted basis, assuming no redemptions by shareholders of Agrico.",1
"If no public shareholders of Agrico exercise their redemption rights, existing Kalera equity holders will own approximately 52%, and Agrico shareholders would own approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing.",1
"If some Agrico shareholders redeem their shares, Kalera shareholders would own a higher percentage of the combined company and Agrico shareholders would own a smaller percentage.",1
"The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both of Kalera and Agrico, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.",1
"The transaction remains subject to approval by both Agrico and Kalera shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions.",1
"Additional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the business combination agreement, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Agrico with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).",1

"Rivals since the 19th century, Veolia pursued the smaller Suez arguing that together they could better fight off new global challengers emerging in China.",1
Shares in Veolia were up over 9% and Suez climbed 7.8% by 1423 GMT.,1
"""The time for confrontation is over,"" Veolia CEO and Chairman Antoine Frerot said in a statement.",0
"Paris-based Suez rebuffed Veolia's advances since its rival bought a stake in the firm last October, and in February it rejected a 11.3 billion euro takeover bid.",1
"Veolia had been trying to get permission to vote, which could have resulted in moves to oust Suez's management.",1
"Suez ceded ground on some fronts, accepting that a side-agreement to spin off some of its assets into a separate entity with new shareholders would be smaller than it had hoped for, but the group said it was satisfied with the outcome and price.",1
"""We used all the levers we had to defend the interests of the company in the face of a hostile situation,"" Suez Chairman Philipp Varin told reporters.",0
The deal with Veolia also includes job guarantees for Suez employees for a four-year period.,1
"Varin met Frerot over the weekend to clinch the deal, a source familiar with the discussions said.",1
"Frerot and Varin said at separate news conferences that Gerard Mestrallet, who used to chair Suez and also French utility Engie, had helped broker talks between the companies.",1
The companies said they aimed to reach a definitive merger agreement by May 14.,1
"Investment funds Meridiam, Ardian and Global Infrastructure Partners as well as state-backed Caisse des Depots and employees will be shareholders in the ""new Suez"".",1
"That new entity will mainly comprise Suez's French water activities, but also some international assets, including in Italy, the Czech Republic, India and Australia.",1
"As part of the takeover, members of Suez management will be represented at several levels, Frerot told reporters.",1
"Veolia had originally offered 15.5 euros a share when it first tried to buy a stake in Suez from Engie (ENGIE.PA), before raising that to 18 euros and sealing a deal in October.",1
"Hometown International — the New Jersey company valued at more than $100 million on the stock market despite running just a single deli — is in fact a shell company that’s part of a complex, international reverse-merger plan, according to a report.",1
"Peter Coker Jr., the Asia-based chairman and recently appointed CEO of Hometown, approached a Hong Kong hedge fund called Maso Capital Partners in early 2020 about using Hometown as a shell company for a reverse merger, according to the New York Times Magazine.",1
"In this case, the idea reportedly was to use Hometown’s listing on the over-the-counter US markets to give a foreign company access to American capital by merging with Hometown.",1
"Manoj Jain, an alumnus of Credit Suisse and co-chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based hedge fund Maso, confirmed to the Times that the firm still plans to execute a merger with Hometown.",1
"It’s unclear exactly when Maso made its initial investment in Hometown, which the Times pegged at $2.5 million, but the stock price of the company was much lower at the beginning of 2020 and only began to rise in the spring and through the summer.",0
"The target would then take Hometown over, acquiring a greater than 51 percent share.",1
"But all that doesn’t answer the question of Hometown’s bizarre valuation of nearly $100 million despite it losing cash and doing just over $35,000 in sales over the past two years combined.",0
Market capitalization is one criteria exchanges consider when deciding to list companies.,0
"The Times noted, though, that Hometown faced various other barriers to finding its way to a major exchange, if that was the goal.",0
"Einhorn noted that the company had reached that eye-popping valuation despite reporting total sales of less than $37,000 over the past two years and was closed for nearly half of 2020 due to pandemic restrictions.",0
"“Management is aware of no basis to support the company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets,” the company said in an April 30 statement.",0
"Rising Spear, a company aimed at developing NIL (Name Image Likeness) opportunities for Florida State University student-athletes, announced Thursday it is merging with Warpath 850.",1
"The merger will give student-athletes under contract with Rising Spear access to Warpath’s Dreamfield platform, a subscription service which provides behind-the-scenes access to events and meetups with student athletes.",1
"Warpath 850’s past events have included FSU athletes such as first-round draft pick Jermaine Johnson II of the New York Jets, Amari Gainer, Skey Ekes, Camm McDonald and Dillan Gibbons.",0
"The merger is the first consolidation between two NIL organizations focused on the same institution, said Rising Spear CEO Matthew Quigley.",1
"“This exciting merger between Rising Spear and Warpath 850 will create a strong, unified membership platform to benefit Seminole student-athletes,” Quigley said.",1
He said the merger is historic.,1
"“It is the first time the industry is seeing two groups that were on parallel tracks in the same town now team up in a peaceful way to further benefit the athletes at the institution,” Staniscia said.",1
"“Dreamfield’s only goal is to produce high-quality cash value commercial opportunities to as many athletes as possible in a legal, safe, and compliant manner.",0
"Discovery and AT&T have determined the 13 members of the board of directors for Warner Bros Discovery, the new company that will be created via a pending $43 billion merger.",1
"The board includes many existing directors for Discovery and AT&T, parent of WarnerMedia and soon to be a partner in the new entity.",1
"Samuel Di Piazza, who currently sits on AT&T’s board, will be chairman of Warner Bros.",1
"Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who will lead the new company, will be a Discovery designee to the WBD Board.",1
"As agreed in the initial merger proposal last May, Discovery gets six designated board members and AT&T gets seven.",1
"John Malone, a billionaire and widely respected media veteran, is one of the key Discovery choices and had long advocated for the merger with WarnerMedia.",1
Current AT&T board members being named to the WBD Board will step down from their AT&T board positions upon the closing of the combination.,1
"When it was announced last month that Monster Beverage was acquiring the CANarchy Craft Collective for $330 million, most thought that that meant that their possible merger with Constellation Brands was off the table.",1
"Well, it appears that the two companies are still in talks and that a potential deal may be announced in the next few weeks.",1
"The two companies combined market value would be nearly $92 billion, and the structure of any potential deal is unknown right now.",1
"According to the latest data, both have similar market capitalizations: Constellation Brands at $44.3 billion and Monster at $43.7.",0
"Constellation Brands, one of the world's largest wine companies, is expected to become the third-largest beer supplier in the United State today with a $5.3 billion purchase of the U.S. distribution rights of Grupo Modelo beers from Anheuser Busch InBev.",1
"Corona Extra, brewed by Grupo Modelo, is the number one selling imported beer sold in the United States and the number six selling beer overall.",0
Those are on top of their powerful wine and spirit catalogs filled with well-known brands like Kim Crawford and Meiomi wines and Svedka vodka and Casa Nobel tequila.,0
"Monster, one of the leaders in the lucrative and booming energy drink market, held a 39% share of the $5.7 billion US market in 2020, second only to Red Bull, would bring an attractive distribution network and a steady revenue stream to the deal.",1
"While all of the above have worked on partnership products recently, each has stayed out of the other's space.",0
"That would be because Constellation has an almost 40% stake in Canopy Growth Corp, a Canadian cannabis company that sells THC-infused drinks across Canada.",0
"“We view this as the most likely scenario if a deal were to go through, considering the similar market capitalization of the two companies (Monster at ~$43 billion and Constellation at ~$44 billion), he says.",1
"According to Modi, the first would be that the co-CEOs of the Monster, Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, are 71 and 68, respectively, and might not have the ""appetite to go through a large-scale acquisition.",1
"“We believe Monster could be less interested in Constellation’s wine & spirits business vs. the beer business in a hypothetical acquisition, given potentially lower synergies in wine and a lower topline growth profile of the business,"" said Modi.",1
"That could lead to Monster selling off the parts of the Constellation portfolio that they don't need, bringing in some quick revenue.",0
"According to RBC, the possibility of Constellation acquiring Monster seems the least plausible due to poor profitability and synergies.",1
Any merger of this size would have to undergo government scrutiny and win approval.,1
"It seems that all of the whispers and behind closed doors discussions will be answered soon, and there quite possibly could be another seismic shift in the beverage world.",0
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block a $13 billion acquisition of a health technology company by a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, in the latest move by the Biden administration to clamp down on corporate consolidation.",1
The agency argued that a deal by UnitedHealth to buy the health tech firm Change Healthcare would give UnitedHealth sensitive data that it could wield against its competitors in the insurance business.,1
"A spokeswoman for Optum, the UnitedHealth subsidiary, said in a statement that the Justice Department’s “deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the health care system,” and added that the company would “defend our case vigorously.” A spokeswoman for Change Healthcare said it was still “working toward closing the merger as we comply with our obligations under the merger agreement.”",1
