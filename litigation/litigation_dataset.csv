The potential ethics violation regards two DFEH lawyers who used to work with the EEOC on the case.,1

What is the Activision Blizzard lawsuit?,1
"The crux of the suit, which came after a two-year investigation, alleges that the company had created a ""frat boy"" culture where female employees were subjected to pay disparities, sexual harassment, and retaliation when they came forward.",1
The suit claims that the DFEH attempted to contact Activision Blizzard about the allegations prior to filing.,1
"The DFEH also said in the court documents that efforts to mediate were made, but they were unsuccessful.",1
"The DFEH is seeking relief for all the affected female employees, including punitive damages and unpaid wages.",1
What claims are present in the lawsuit?,1
"Even when they do, they earn a smaller salary than their male counterparts and are offered fewer stock and incentive pay opportunities.",0
The suit begins with the claim that the company is only staffed by around 20% women.,1
"""Women were steered into the lower levels of Defendants' hierarchy and often had to work harder and longer to earn equal promotional and other opportunities as their male counterparts,"" the suit said.",1
"Similarly, the court documents state that male employees would get away with coming into work hungover and playing video games while delegating their work to female employees.",1
They would also get opportunities that their female employees were not privy to.,0
Sexual harassment was also rampant across the company.,0
"The suit lists several examples, including the pervasiveness of ""cube crawls,"" where male employees would drift from cubicle to cubicle harassing other employees.",1
"One person named in the lawsuit was Alex Afrasiabi, who was formerly the senior creative director on World of Warcraft.",1
The company's culture particularly targeted women of color.,0
The suit also claims that pregnancy discrimination occurred at the company.,1
"For example, one woman said that she was denied a promotion because ""they could not risk promoting her as she might get pregnant and like being a mom too much.""",0
"In one particularly heartbreaking example, a female employee died by suicide on a business trip after sexual harassment.",0

Other responses from company leadership have been mixed.,0
"Former Blizzard President J. Allen Brack, who is named in the lawsuit, called the allegations ""extremely troubling"" in an internal email.",1
"On the other hand, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Frances Townsend echoed the original company statement in her internal email.",0
"She said the lawsuit ""presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago.""",1
"I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding,"" Kotick wrote.",0
What's next for Activision Blizzard and the lawsuit?,1
It's unlikely that the case will go to trial.,1
"Based on company leadership's statements and internal emails, we expected an overview of hiring practices, or at least a statement breaking down how the company will do so, and that has happened.",0
"Activision Blizzard also hired a third-party law firm, WilmerHale, to review company policies.",0
"According to an Uppercut Crit article, a source mentioned that ""any future all hands style meetings have been tabled in favor of smaller group 'discussion sessions.'""",0
"So far, Afrasiabi references have been removed from World of Warcraft and Jesse McCree's name was changed in Overwatch, but we're sure to see other changes moving forward.",0
Don't expect the company to unionize.,0
They hope to mostly work with company leadership to fix the systemic problems named in the lawsuit and continue evolving their demands based on the responses.,1
They also noted that they expect to work with leadership no matter how long it takes to make sure demands are met.,0

On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Justice said it was in breach of a 2019 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for failing to fully disclose details of its operations in Iraq.,1
"Under the conditions of the 2019 DPA, Ericsson paid more than $1 billion to resolve a series of corruption probes, involving bribery in China, Vietnam and Djibouti, and agreed to cooperate with the department for ongoing investigations.",0

"FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bayer AG, after more than a year of talks, agreed to pay as much as $10.9 billion to settle close to 100,000 U.S. lawsuits claiming that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup caused cancer, resolving litigation that has pummeled the company’s share price.",1
"The German drugs and pesticides maker has come to terms with about 75% of the 125,000 filed and unfiled claims overall, it said in a statement on Wednesday of the deal to end legal disputes it inherited with its $63 billion takeover of Monsanto in 2018.",1
"The settled cases over Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers account for about 95% of those currently set for trial, it added.",1
"“Bayer is not getting complete relief, but trying to do as much as it can to calm uncertainty,” said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School who has followed the litigation.",1
A U.S. federal appeals court on Monday permanently blocked California from requiring a cancer warning on glyphosate-based Roundup.,1
That ruling is separate from the wider litigation over whether Roundup causes a type of blood cancer.,1
"The company, whose management in April regained shareholder support for its handling of the litigation, has denied claims that Roundup or its active ingredient glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the product is safe for human use.",1
Bayer said it expects to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and intends to keep its dividend policy.,0
"The prospect of a surge in fresh lawsuits, fighting more than 20 trials a year and the accompanying unfavorable media coverage swayed Bayer to come to terms with claimants.",1
"“We are well aware of the negative impact high profile trials already have had on our business and reputation,” Baumann said.",1
"At one point last year as juries ruled against the company, Bayer’s market value had fallen below what it paid for Monsanto.",1
"As of April, the company had been sued by 52,500 U.S. plaintiffs who blame glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer, up from 48,600 in February.",1
Law firms had lined up tens of thousands of additional claimants with cases yet to serve.,1
"Bayer will continue to sell Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974.",0
Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company’s genetically modified seeds.,0
Potential future cases will be governed by a class agreement subject to court approval.,1
"Bayer and the plaintiffs are bound by the panel’s determination and no new lawsuits can be filed while the experts evaluate the science, a process expected to take about four years, Bayer said.",1
"Separately, Bayer agreed to resolve most cases in litigation over waste water contaminated with PCB, which Monsanto manufactured before 1977, for $820 million.",1
It also came to terms for up to $400 million to resolve lawsuits brought by land owners who say their crops were damaged by neighbors using Bayer’s dicamba-based weedkiller.,1

"The ClientEarth lawyers said they are seeking to hold the directors personally liable for what they consider to be a failure to adequately prepare for the global shift to a low-carbon economy, claiming an alleged breach of the directors' duties under the UK Companies Act.",1
ClientEarth said it had written to Shell notifying it of its claim and was waiting for it to respond before filing papers at the High Court of England and Wales.,1
"For the case to proceed, ClientEarth would then need permission from the court to do so.",1

"July 18 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is exploring a plan to offload liabilities from widespread Baby Powder litigation into a newly created business that would then seek bankruptcy protection, according to seven people familiar with the matter.",1
"Plaintiffs’ lawyers would initially be unable to stop J&J from taking such a step, though could pursue legal avenues to challenge it later.",1
"J&J has not yet decided whether to pursue the bankruptcy plan and could ultimately abandon the idea, some of the people said.",0
The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma.,1
"“Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,” the J&J subsidiary housing the company’s talc products said in a statement provided to Reuters.",1
"Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company.",1
Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities.,1
"J&J is now considering using Texas's “divisive merger” law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities.",0
"For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation, some of the people said.",1
"A bottle of Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016.",0
"The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” about the talc-based product.",0
"The blue-chip company, which boasts a roughly $443 billion market value, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe.",1
"In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J’s appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company’s talc caused their ovarian cancer.",1
"In 2017, Brawny paper towels manufacturer Georgia-Pacific used the Texas law to move asbestos liabilities to an entity that later filed for bankruptcy in North Carolina.",0
"Bankruptcy cases filed to resolve litigation, including those related to asbestos, often take years, and almost never fully repay creditors.",1
"J&J also faces litigation alleging it contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic and recently recalled certain spray sunscreen products after discovering some of them contained low levels of benzene, another carcinogen.",1
The company in June agreed to pay $263 million to resolve opioid claims in New York.,1
"The court's decision in the case will have implications for a raft of similar cases brought by cities, counties and states across the country.",1
"The case was brought by the city of Baltimore against some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, and it hinges on alleged disinformation by the corporations.",1
"The Baltimore city government argues that the companies must help pay for the costs of climate change, because they misled the public about how their products contribute to global warming.",1
"Like many cities in the United States, Baltimore has borne enormous and escalating climate costs, including millions of dollars of damage from floods and expensive infrastructure upgrades to address dangerous heat waves and rising seas.",0
Baltimore was one of the first places to file a lawsuit seeking damages from fossil fuel companies.,1
"Since then, numerous cities, including Oakland, Calif., New York, N.Y., Annapolis, Md., Charleston, S.C. and Honolulu, Hawaii have pursued similar suits.",1
None of the cases has progressed far enough for a judge or jury to hear any substantive arguments about whether oil and gas companies should pay for the damages caused by burning fossil fuels.,1
"Instead, the fossil fuel companies have focused their defense on the narrow jurisdictional question of whether such lawsuits can proceed in state courts, where they were originally filed.",1
"The Supreme Court considered the jurisdiction question in the Baltimore case last year, and decided that a federal appeals court should decide where the Baltimore lawsuit is heard, paving the way for today's arguments before a three-judge panel for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.",1
"The decision by the appeals court could affect the outcomes of other cases, especially the lawsuits brought by cities and counties that fall within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Circuit, such as Charleston, S.C. and Annapolis, Md.",1
"For example, if the appeals court finds that Baltimore's lawsuit can be tried in state court, that decision would also apply to the suits brought by those cities.",1
"In his statement on behalf of oil and gas companies, attorney Kannon Shanmugam argued that state court is the wrong place for the lawsuit because climate change is global in scope, and is regulated by the federal government and by international agreements.",1
"The National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group, made an even more sweeping argument in a brief filed in support of the companies, writing, ""state courts are not positioned to decide who, if anyone, is to be legally accountable for climate change, how energy policies should change to address it, and how local mitigation projects should be funded.""",1
"Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans who studies climate liability cases, says that argument doesn't hold water, because the allegations against the companies hinge on state laws that are meant to protect the public from misleading marketing.",1
"Baltimore is asking state courts to weigh in on what Sokol calls a ""long-standing, systematic deceptive marketing campaign designed to hide the catastrophic dangers,"" of fossil fuels.",1
"Cases about consumer protection, including landmark lawsuits involving alleged corporate misinformation campaigns by tobacco companies, have historically been tried in state court.",1
The appeals court is expected to announce its decision about jurisdiction later this year.,1
"Spurred by the Russia-OPEC dispute and the worldwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the price of oil has fallen to historical lows.",0
A deluge of bankruptcies in the oil sector appears inevitable.,0
"Plaintiffs’ lawyers are typically eager to take these cases, even on a contingency fee basis, because the D&O insurance policies are an enticing source of funds.",1
"Additionally, the bankruptcy trustee or, following confirmation of a bankruptcy plan, a litigation trustee (“Litigation Trustee”) has an obligation to maximize the value of estate assets, and will likely view claims against former directors and officers as an aspect of discharging that duty.",1
"In our view, breach of fiduciary duty claims are more dangerous when pursued by a Litigation Trustee than when pursued by shareholders in derivative litigation, for several reasons.",1
"First, a Litigation Trustee generally has access to all the bankrupt company’s documents and emails, without the need to engage in litigation discovery.",1
"Second, to the extent the Litigation Trustee needs additional discovery, it may have access to the more expansive discovery procedures provided by the bankruptcy court.",1
"For example, some courts have allowed trustees to take pre-suit, “fishing expedition” depositions under Bankruptcy Rule 2004.",0
"Third, the estate—not the Ds&Os—owns the attorney-client and work-product privileges, and often the litigation trust shares the privilege with the estate.",1
"Finally, unlike shareholder actions, a Litigation Trustee generally does not have to comply with Delaware requirements such as making a formal demand on the Board before bringing litigation.",1

"Another important defense for directors is appropriate reliance on management, accountants, counsel, and other advisors in reaching their challenged decision.",0
"To establish a breach of loyalty, a plaintiff must show that the officers or directors authorized a transaction when they either were self-interested (i.e., stand to obtain a unique benefit that is not available to shareholders) or lacked independence.",1
"See Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345, 358 (Del.",1
"If an officer or director discloses a personal interest prior to the transaction in question, and that transaction is approved by a majority of independent, disinterested directors, then the protection of the business judgment rule will apply to the transaction.",0
"For this reason, it is important for boards to convene a special committee of independent directors to approve any transaction that raises, or may appear to raise, a conflict of interest.",0
"Finally, the duty of loyalty also requires directors to “make a good faith effort to implement an oversight system and then monitor it.” Marchand v. Barnhill, 212 A.3d 805, 820–21 (Del.",0

"To avoid a Caremark claim, directors should take care to document its deliberations and, in particular, note instances when management is challenged or questioned.",0

"So long as the company was not insolvent at the time of the transaction, creditors generally lack standing to challenge the board’s decision to approve transactions, including deals which in hindsight cause or exacerbate financial harm to the company.",0
"Thus, it is prudent for directors considering a transaction during times of financial distress to document that their company is in fact solvent at the time of the transaction.",0
Delaware courts require a director or officer to be more deliberate and informed the more complex or important a decision is.,1
"During these challenging times, Ds&Os must consider carefully how they can discharge their duty of care if they, or others in the company, are working remotely.",0
Future plaintiffs will undoubtedly scrutinize whether adequate information-sharing and discussion occurred before key decisions.,1
"Remote work may encourage people at all levels of an organization to send via email information that would have otherwise been shared in person, creating a potential treasure trove of problematic documents for future litigation.",1
"Finally, cybersecurity risks increase as employees share information in new ways that may not be adequately controlled by the company.",0
"However, certain types of decisions are more likely to be subject to future litigation and should be treated with particular care.",1
"First, as noted above, displaced shareholders often challenge restructure agreements that result in a change of control.",0
"While directors and officers are permitted to pursue creative restructuring plans, they should carefully document the reasoning supporting such a decision.",0
"Second, a Litigation Trustee may challenge investments in affiliated businesses that are not entirely owned and/or controlled by the primary company.",1
"If these affiliates don’t provide the expected return to the primary company, then a Litigation Trustee may allege that such payments breach the duties owed to the primary company’s shareholders.",1
"If the company creates new funding obligations to affiliates during this time, then the Ds&Os should be particularly careful to document the advantages of this arrangement to the primary company.",0
"If the corporation was insolvent when these distributions to shareholders were made or was rendered insolvent by these distributions or other transactions, then the creditors may allege that the Ds&Os breached their fiduciary duties by effecting these distributions or that these distributions were fraudulent transfers.",1
"Delaware law “fully protect[s]” directors who rely in good faith on corporate records, corporate officers, and outside experts to determine the value of the corporation’s assets and liabilities.",0
"For this reason, directors considering a dividend payment or stock buyback generally solicit a certification from the CFO or an outside expert.",0

The plaintiffs say the Landisville company failed to turn over certain property as prescribed by borough ordinance.,1
"Landisville supporters maintain the plaintiffs have received what they need, and that outstanding property still belongs to the private Landisville company, rather than the dissolved public district.",1
The dissolution and lawsuit have galvanized an ongoing opposition campaign against the then members of council.,1
"Two were unseated in the November election, and two people who voted for the dissolution are being challenged in the June 7 Republican primary.",0
"Council member Jorge Alvarez, who had seconded the motion, said he would be willing to vote in favor of dropping the suit if the Landisville litigants, many of whom were in the approximately 20-person audience May 23, agreed to resolve the dispute outside of litigation.",1
Some people involved in the litigation said they did not want to meet about the case without first talking with their lawyers.,1
"Others in the audience said the underlying cause of the lawsuit would have to be addressed, namely the dissolution of Fire District No.",1
"2, which is a separate municipal entity, meaning the borough does not have the power to end all legal action by itself.",1
Council member Joseph D’Alessandro III said he was concerned about how dropping the lawsuit would affect the borough’s ability to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to the firefighters of the former Fire District No.,1
He said the litigation would allow Fire District No.,1

"A hearing is scheduled for Friday, April 29.",1
"In court, Lasky’s attorney, Doug Wexler, told Quish that What If’s HR department was investigating an incident involving Pisor and marketing director Molly Currey.",1
"A police report filed by Currey on March 11 claims PIsor made two early morning visits to her Logan Square residence, at 4:28 a.m. and again around 6:30 a.m., when he knocked on her front and back doors and called her name.",0
Currey says she is now “afraid of him” after dealing with a series of “verbally abusive and aggressive behavior” through the years.,0

"In court, Wexler said he’d be happy to return Pisor’s computer “as a going-away present.” He painted Pisor as an absentee owner.",1
"The judge said the police report and affidavits were categorized as “unverified banter,” and that she would only consider whether the operating agreement was violated and Lasky had legal grounds to oust Pisor.",1

"A now-suspended Miami lawyer, along with the successor to his law firm, a public claims adjuster and a restoration company, have agreed to pay a total of $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Citizens Property Insurance Corp. that had accused the defendants of fraud in hundreds of insurance claims.",1
"The settlement is far less than what Citizens, Florida’s largest property insurer, had initially sought from attorney Scot Strems and his co-defendants.",1
But officials said it should help deter other bad actors in a fraud-plagued Florida litigation environment.,1
"“This settlement certainly accomplishes what we set out to do, which was to seek justice for what we saw as an egregious fraud and to expose the threat of this type of activity,” said Joseph Theobald, senior director of Citizens’ special investigations unit.",0
Citizens filed the suit in 2020.,1
"That was about the same time that the Florida Bar moved to suspend Strems for violating numerous Bar rules, including filing thousands of lawsuits against insurers, many of them on the same claim.",1
Also named in the suit and settlement are Contender Claims Consultants in Miami and its principal Guillermo Saavedra; and All Insurance Restoration Services and company leaders Cesar Guerrero and Derek Parsons.,1
"“Had this fraud been left unchecked, it could have cost policyholders $16 million a year,” Patronis said in a statement.",0
A lawyer for Strems and the new firm said Thursday that the $1 million settlement was a pittance compared to the $65 million that Citizens had demanded early in the legal process and that it did not cover the insurer’s investigative and legal costs.,1
"He noted that at a 2021 hearing, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman, the same judge who is overseeing a $1 billion settlement in the Champlain Towers condominium collapse, questioned the sagacity of Citizens proceeding with the lawsuit.",1
"“I would strongly encourage Citizens, before it requires the taxpayers to fund this litigation much longer, that it seriously explore potential resolution, given the limited nature of the funds that may be available as well as the legal obstacles to this claim,” the judge said, according to an official transcript of the hearing that Schifino provided to the Insurance Journal.",1
Florida law requires that the insurer levy additional assessments on policyholders only if it experiences a deficit in the wake of catastrophic losses.,0
"Schifino said that Citizens’ years-long investigation “was proving to be very expensive to Citizens,” but had produced little evidence against his clients.",1
"Citizens said its investigative unit began digging into the Strems firm in 2016, after seeing suspicious patterns in claims and claims litigation.",1
"In 2020, Citizens went ahead with its lawsuit, alleging that the defendants had formed an illicit enterprise, all working together to defraud insurers.",1
"The enterprise violated state and federal anti-racketeering laws, created false invoices and inflated the cost of claims, mostly on non-weather water damage, the suit charged.",1
"The alleged fraud usually began with a Contender adjuster promising free home remodels to homeowners, the lawsuit’s 392-page amended complaint reads.",1
"The DFS’s own investigation into Strems, Contender Claims Consultants and another law firm appeared to be making progress in recent years, despite a lack of cooperation from defendants.",1
"Agency investigators subpoenaed records from Contender and others, but the defendants refused to comply, according to court records.",1
"In 2021, a circuit court judge essentially ordered Contender to comply.",1
"Then, In September last year, DFS appeared to drop the pursuit of the records.",0
"Schifino said he was not familiar with the DFS investigation, and DFS officials were not available late Thursday.",0
"Citizens’ leaders did not say how the defendants in the civil suit would share the burden of paying the $1 million settlement, or if it has been paid.",1

"States have similarly demonstrated an increased focus on ESG regulations: a dozen state attorneys general, including those of California and New York, sent a letter to the SEC last year that called for increased ESG-related disclosures for climate-related financial risks by “all SEC-regulated firms.” Notably, foreign regulators have been ahead of their U.S. counterparts in focusing on ESG disclosures; in particular, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) in the European Union will require disclosure of ESG considerations by all funds.",0
"The growing ESG fund sector has also been the subject of recent public criticism from various quarters, particularly claims of greenwashing leveled against climate-focused funds, from media outlets including Time, USA Today, The Economist, Reclaim Finance, and Responsible Investor.",0
"Indeed, SEC Chair Gary Gensler published a video on March 1, 2022 in which he expressed skepticism about whether many ESG-focused funds live up to their names, asserting that the investing public does not have sufficient information to evaluate ESG funds.",0
"For its part, the private plaintiffs’ bar has initiated a number of actions asserting greenwashing claims, although the focus of these claims to date has not been ESG funds, but rather allegations that operating companies, including corporations in the oil and gas, mining, and consumer goods sectors, are making misleading claims about the climate-friendliness of their operations or the products they manufacture.",1
"See, e.g., Jochims v. Oatly Group AB, 1:21-cv-06360 (S.D.N.Y.",1
"Oct. 26, 2021) (order granting motion to dismiss claims that an oat milk company made materially false and misleading statements about the company’s sustainability); In re Vale S.A. Sec.",1
"Litig., 2020 WL 2610979, at *9 (E.D.N.Y.",1
"May 20, 2020) (alleging securities law claims that a mining accident demonstrated a Brazilian mining company’s sustainability and safety claims were misleading); Ramirez v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 334 F. Supp.",1
2018) (denying a motion to dismiss claims that Exxon made material misstatements about proxy costs for carbon).,1
What do these trends mean for litigation exposure faced by ESG funds and their advisers and boards?,1
"Specifically, can we anticipate that private plaintiffs’ lawyers and securities regulators will fix their sights on ESG funds, embracing the greenwashing criticism by public commentators as a basis for launching a wave of securities fraud litigation and enforcement actions?",1
"For a number of reasons, assertions that climate-focused ESG funds are “not as green as they should be” may prove challenging for the plaintiffs’ bar in establishing valid securities law claims in the fund context.",1
ESG fund disclosures differ in fundamental ways from the ESG disclosures of typical operating companies.,0
"In light of these differences, as well as established securities law principles governing fund litigation, the types of theories recently asserted against operating companies will not be readily transportable to the ESG fund setting, as discussed below.",1
"Today, environmental disclosures largely are pursuant to the SEC’s general principles-based disclosure framework and grounded in materiality.",0
"In the last several months, the SEC has sought to encourage enhanced climate-risk disclosure consistent with the current disclosure framework by publishing a sample comment letter on this topic and commenting on climate-related disclosures in selected public filings.",0
A large number of public companies also make substantial voluntary sustainability and corporate social responsibility disclosures—these go well beyond those required by SEC rules—on their websites and/or in stand-alone “corporate social responsibility” (CSR) or “corporate sustainability” reports.,0
Many companies also voluntarily submit environmental and other information to third party rankers and raters.,0
"By contrast, ESG funds, like all registered investment companies, are subject to a different set of prescribed disclosure requirements than operating companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other securities laws.",0
"Registered ESG funds include open-end mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and a relatively small number of closed-end funds.",0
"In 2021 alone, 38 funds with sustainability mandates were launched in the U.S., 29 of which were equity funds and 25 were ETFs.",0
"Significantly, as required by law, registered funds also regularly disclose their full portfolio holdings.",0
17 C.F.R.,0
§ 270.6c-11(c)(1) (describing ETF portfolio holdings disclosure requirements).,0
The types of representations that have been the focus of greenwashing litigation against operating companies are not the types of statements that funds historically have had a basis or reason to make.,1
"In describing its investment process, a fund will often disclose the industry classifications and research services its adviser utilizes in making ESG-focused investing determinations, or, alternatively, the metrics and criteria the adviser has developed in-house.",0
"From a securities liability perspective, it would be challenging for a shareholder-plaintiff to plausibly allege—at least based on typical fund litigation evidence like portfolio holdings or performance results—material misrepresentations in such process descriptions.",1
"As part of an ongoing industry-wide effort in the U.S. to standardize terminology for registered funds, industry groups have proposed some basic categories of investment approach.",0
"Conversely, ESG inclusionary funds actively pursue positive sustainability-related outcomes and financial performance through a focused investment thesis that tilts their portfolios according to the relevant ESG factors—without necessarily excluding particular sectors.",0
"These categories closely track those published by the UK Investments Association and the Institute of International Finance; in contrast, some industry participants have suggested further breakdown of these categories with additional labels like “limiting ESG risk” and “seeking ESG opportunity,” or the inclusion of categories that identify funds that utilize “corporate engagement & shareholder action,” “norms-based screening,” and “sustainability themed/thematic investing.” Thus, even among ESG funds, there can be substantial variation in the types of disclosures made, given the variation in funds’ approaches to incorporating ESG principles in their investment processes and the funds’ ESG and investment goals.",0
An “ESG Inclusionary” sustainable fund might explain the relative weighting given to oil and gas companies in the portfolio based on their progress towards reducing their net carbon impact (while not excluding them outright).,0
"Similarly, an “ESG bond fund” might take an Exclusionary approach, declining to invest in any bond issued by oil, gas or utility companies, whereas a green bond fund with an Inclusionary or Impact approach might consider a bond of a high-emitting company if the project financed by the bond appeared likely to bring about net reductions in emissions.",0
"These assertions are often based on a flawed premise: they grade how “green” a fund’s holdings are, as measured by the grader’s selected yardstick, rather than assess whether the fund is managed consistent with the manner described in its prospectus and other disclosures—the appropriate metric under the securities laws.",0
"A shareholder asserting a securities law claim against a fund must plausibly allege that the fund’s disclosures contained material misstatements or omissions that would mislead a reasonable investor about the nature of the fund, its investment approach, or the risks that the fund might not meet its objectives, in light of the total mix of information available to the investor about the fund.",1
"In assessing claims of misleading disclosures, courts will recognize that the total mix of information available includes the description of the fund’s specific approach to incorporating ESG factors (e.g., exclusionary vs. inclusionary) and the fund’s regular disclosure of the securities it holds.",1
One recent example is particularly instructive in demonstrating what can be missed in attempting to compare ESG investment products that might have varying and divergent investment approaches by design.,0
The report examined 94 mutual funds and ETFs with “ESG” in their name.,0
The report found that it could not differentiate between language used by “good” ESG funds—ones that received all C or higher grades across all metrics relied upon by AYS—and the language used by “bad” funds—ones that received at least one D or F grade.,0
"The Fossil Free Funds rating, for example, is based on the aggregate percentage of the fund’s holdings in companies identified by a handful of outside organizations as oil, gas and coal producers, owners of carbon reserves, and large consumers of fossil fuels (e.g., utilities).",0
"At most, this grading system could assess the success of funds with an exclusionary approach in screening out companies considered to be non-green investments using a specified metric.",0
"Put simply, not every “green” fund must be fully divested of fossil fuel-related stocks in order to comply with its stated and disclosed investment objectives.",0
"Instead, any analysis of a fund’s ESG success must be based on the disclosures made to the public regarding its own objectives and whether they have been met.",0
"Notwithstanding the lack of basis in the securities law standards, claims like AYS’s of widespread “greenwashing” in the fund industry could trigger the plaintiffs’ bar to launch a wave of costly meritless litigation and ultimately be counterproductive for the sustainable investment movement.",1
"The news media amplify the message that ESG funds are somehow misleading investors, but fail to engage with the underlying claims—thus ignoring one-dimensional grading systems and the less-than-rigorous methodologies.",0
"He suggests that selecting an ESG fund should be more like selecting “fat-free” milk at a grocery store, where the grams of fat, an objective measurement, can easily be ascertained by looking at the nutrition facts on the carton.",0
ESG investors are not “shopping” for a uniform type of product that can be compared and thus “labeled” based on a single component like grams of fat.,0
Allowing for a variety of different ESG products that pursue ESG objectives in different ways provides investors with numerous options to meet their distinct goals.,0
"It would be difficult in most cases to plausibly allege a materially misleading misstatement or omission in a fund disclosure on the theory that a “green” fund is not “green enough.” Plaintiff-shareholders claiming to have been misled are deemed to have read a fund’s full disclosures, and must explain how they were misled about the fund or its risks in light of the “total mix of information” available to them.",1
"For example, a shareholder could not claim to have been misled by the word “green” in a fund’s name to believe the fund would never invest in oil or utility companies, if the fund’s prospectus explained how its investment process would be applied to such companies (without necessarily screening them out altogether) and the fund’s regular holdings reports clearly disclosed holdings in these types of companies.",0
"Further, like all funds, ESG funds include in their disclosures detailed explanations of the risks that could prevent the fund from meeting its objectives—both financial results and ESG-related goals.",0
The law is well-established that securities liability does not attach when a fund’s financial under-performance results from the manifestation of a fully-disclosed risk.,0
"See, e.g., Olkey v. Hyperion 1999 Term Tr., Inc., 98 F.3d 2, 9 (2d Cir.",1
"Moreover, plaintiff-shareholders in securities litigation would be required to allege and establish causation—that is, that a drop in the fund’s share price was caused by the alleged misstatement or omission in the fund’s disclosures.",1
"See, e.g., Dura Pharm.",0
"v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 343 (2005) (noting that securities laws exist, “not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause”).",1
"Doing so would likely be even more difficult where the disclosures in question relate to the incorporation of ESG considerations in the investment process, rather than typical financial risks.",0
Clear disclosure of each fund’s distinct investment approach remains the key to aligning fund objectives with the full panoply of investor values.,0
"But the use of inconclusive studies and litigation as tools to pressure fund managers to pursue particular favored approaches to ESG investing—especially without due regard for funds’ disclosed objectives and approaches—will find little support in the securities laws, and will ultimately serve to undermine the responsible investing movement.",1
"Eargo Inc. (Eargo), a for-profit public corporation headquartered in California that sells and dispenses hearing aid devices directly to customers nationwide, has agreed to pay $34.37 million to resolve allegations that it submitted or caused the submission of claims for hearing aid devices for reimbursement to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) that contained unsupported hearing loss diagnosis codes.",1
"The FEHBP, administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is the largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program in the world.",0
"Certain FEHBP health insurance plans elect to offer a hearing aid benefit, which varies from plan to plan.",0
"These diagnosis codes must be supported by a hearing loss diagnosis, which is typically based on a hearing test performed by a health care provider.",0
“Billing the program for medical devices patients may not need raises costs across the board.,0
"The United States further alleged that between Feb. 1, 2021, and Sept. 22, 2021, Eargo continued to include these unsupported hearing loss-related diagnosis codes on claims and superbills — even after completing an internal review of its billing and coding practices in January 2021 — resulting in Eargo knowingly submitting or causing the submission of false claims for payment to the FEHBP.",1
"The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, with assistance from OPM-OIG.",1

Apothio is hoping investors want a piece of its lawsuit accusing California officials of improperly destroying its $1 billion hemp crop in 2019.,1
"The ILO tag was devised by Apothio’s lawyers at Roche Freedman, who worked with Republic and the blockchain platform developer Ava Labs to structure and implement the offering after first announcing the concept last December.",0
It’s the first time that small investors can put up as little as $100 to acquire a stake in the outcome of civil litigation.,1
"The funder LexShares similarly allows individuals to invest in litigation finance deals, but those investors must meet the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s accreditation criteria.",1
"The Apothio offering, by contrast, is not limited to accredited investors because, in a milestone for litigation finance, the offering was registered under the SEC’s Regulation CF, which allows companies to raise as much as $5 million through crowdfunding without the formal rigamarole of a traditional securities offering.",1
The Apothio offering also appears to be the first time that litigation funding has been “tokenized” through a blockchain.,1
Apothio’s litigation investors will be issued Avalanche ILO tokens.,1
"If the company ends up winning the case and receiving a payout, investors will be paid their share via their Avalanche tokens.",1
"That's more than 60% of the minimum target of $250,000 that Apothio set in its SEC registration of the offering.",0
"“The rise of litigation funding in the United States has provided individuals and smaller organizations access to the resources necessary to assert their legal rights against well-funded entities,” Roche’s statement said.",1
Agee has a more holistic view of the commercial litigation finance industry than anyone else I know.,1
He told me he’s generally in favor of innovation that democratizes and expands the market for litigation funding and is intrigued by Apothio's concept.,1
Agee’s first fear is that small investors don’t have enough litigation savvy and inside information to make informed investment decisions.,1
"In big commercial litigation finance deals, Agee said, funders often have access to non-public information that helps them decide if the case is a good bet.",1
"In Apothio’s offering, Republic is providing links to public filings from its case in federal court in Fresno, California, but no insider take on litigation risk.",1
Agee said he’s also worried that crowdfunding may open the door to dubious suits.,1
"Commercial litigation funders, Agee said, are effective gatekeepers precisely because they make sophisticated evaluations of litigation risk.",1
"After all, when commercial funders back a case, they usually put up a lot of money – an average $4.5 million for single-case deals, according to Westfleet’s analysis of 2020 transactions.",1
"Individual investors who are chipping in as little as $100 may not be as risk averse, Agee said.",0
The Apothio deal does protect investors from the imminent risk that the case will be dismissed.,1
"Apothio sued Kern County, the Kern County sheriff’s office and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife after government officials ordered its 500-acre hemp harvest to be bulldozed in October 2019.",1
"The company, which conducts research on hemp and has research and internship agreements with two local community colleges, contends that the crop was legally grown and illegally destroyed.",1
It is asserting violations of its rights under the U.S. and California constitutions.,1
"Both Kern County and the state have moved to dismiss Apothio’s case, arguing, in broad terms, that Apothio was growing an illegal marijuana crop for commercial distribution.",1
"Marijuana, the defendants argued, remains an illegal controlled substance under federal law and is only allowed to be grown for recreational use under state law.",1
"Apothio’s crop, they said, was contraband that does not give rise to property or constitutional claims.",0
"The underlying law and facts, including the nature of Apothio’s relationships with the community colleges and interpretations of the federal law exempting hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, are complex, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Thurston seems to be in no hurry to rule on the defendants’ dismissal motions.",1
They’ve been fully briefed since the summer of 2020 but the next hearing in the case isn’t scheduled to take place until next January.,1
"If the case is dismissed, Apothio investors will lose only 20% of their investment, under Apothio’s investment contract.",1
"Until Thurston issues a decision on the defendants’ motions to dismiss, Roche Freedman will hold 80% of investors' funds in an escrow account.",1
"If Apothio loses, the law firm will return investors' money.",1

Louisiana local governments scored what they called an “extraordinary victory” this week as federal judges allowed them to use the state court system to seek billions of dollars from oil and gas companies for the state’s receding coastline.,1
"The Aug. 10 ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit gives Louisiana parishes their preferred forum to pursue claims that Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron USA Inc. , and other companies, both large and small, destroyed coastal marshes and wetlands by failing to follow state permits regulating well drilling, canal construction, waste disposal, and landscape restoration.",1
"The litigation has enormously high stakes for the industry, as Louisiana parishes pursue 42 lawsuits aimed at making more than 200 companies cough up billions of dollars for the damage.",1
"The Fifth Circuit’s decision focuses on two cases from Plaquemines and Cameron parishes, but has implications for the dozens of others that have been caught in legal limbo for years.",1
"While the ruling itself is narrow, it clears a path for the parishes’ lawsuits to move toward discovery and trial.",1
"The coastal cases will now move back to state court where—barring any successful rehearing petition or U.S. Supreme Court bid by industry lawyers—plaintiffs will push for a prompt trial date, said Talbot, Carmouche & Marcello APLC attorney John Carmouche, who represents the parishes.",1
"“Whether these cases move forward in federal court or state court, we will continue to defend against the meritless cases and show why the lawsuits do nothing for Louisiana’s coast,” leaders of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association and Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association said in a joint statement.",1
The trade groups’ membership includes defendants in the cases.,1
"The oil companies are exploring their legal options, Melissa Landry, spokeswoman for the legal teams representing BP America Production Company, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Pipeline Co., and Shell, said in a phone interview Thursday.",1
"Nearly 2 million people live and work in the coastal wetlands that act as a buffer against hurricane storm surge, according to Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, a state agency.",0
"But nearly 1,900 square miles of land has been lost since the 1930s, and the state stands to lose another 4,120 square miles over the next 50 years, the agency said.",0
"Human-made factors contribute to land loss, amid natural threats posed by rising sea levels, subsidence, storms, and invasive species.",0
The 42 lawsuits from coastal parishes say they want the oil and gas industry to pay for its role in the slow-moving disaster.,1
"Their claims differ from other cases against oil companies from state and local governments in Maryland, Colorado, California, and elsewhere, which focus on holding the industry financially responsible for the local impacts of climate change, primarily driven by use of fossil fuels.",1
The parishes are hoping to build on the success of private landowners who prevailed when they sued oil and gas companies for damages for not meeting lease provisions requiring them to restore property after drilling.,1
"This spring, state lawmakers killed a bill that would have established a framework for spending the money.",0
"So far, the two sides have been stuck in a legal tug-of-war over where the litigation belongs.",1
"Backed by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and the state attorney general, parish leaders filed their first claims in state court seven years ago.",1
"Industry lawyers unsuccessfully pushed to transfer them to the federal level, arguing that the litigation involved federal questions.",1
"But the industry defendants tried again in 2018, linking their arguments to a new expert report that said the parishes’ claims were based in part on oil and gas drillers’ actions taken during World War II.",1
"The drillers were acting under the direction of federal government officials during the war, so legal claims related to those actions belong in federal court, they argued.",1
"The Fifth Circuit rejected the latest argument as untimely, concluding that the 2018 report simply repeated information the parishes included in earlier legal filings.",1
"The ruling, if it withstands potential challenges, means the cases will move ahead in Louisiana state courts, which Tulane Law School professor Oliver A. Houck said is important.",1
"“Experiences show the venue in these cases is, when it’s federal, can be very hostile” to the plaintiffs, he said.",1
"“That’s exactly what the industry wants,” Houck said.",0
"“At least in state court, you’ve got a fighting chance.”",1
"The securities class action filed on Tuesday in federal court seeks damages on behalf of investors for a stock drop that followed what it called the ""stunning collapse"" of the lender's gain on sale margin in May.",1

"Investor Zoya Qaiyum, represented by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, targeted Rocket executives' statements between February 25 and May 5, 2021, when Rocket's share price fell 17% on news that its quarterly gain on sale margin was at its lowest in two years.",1
"The investor alleges the company and executives touted the metric's strength in February but failed to disclose pressure from competition, a shift to a lower-margin business segment and a tightening gap between mortgage prices on the primary and secondary markets.",1
"As support for the idea that insiders knew more than they let on, the lawsuit points to the first quarter sale of 20.2 million Rocket shares by Rock Holdings Inc, which is majority owned by Quicken Loans founder Daniel Gilbert.",1
"Gilbert is named as a defendant in the lawsuit along with Quicken Loans Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner, Chief Financial Officer Julie Booth and President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Walters.",1

"BOSTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled that Nuveen and trustees of its closed-end funds violated the Investment Company Act by stripping hedge fund Saba Capital of its full voting rights at an annual meeting.",1
"Saba filed litigation against Nuveen funds and their trustees in early 2021, arguing the asset management company illegally amended fund bylaws to prevent large shareholders from voting all of their shares.",1
"The $280 billion closed-end fund market is dominated by Nuveen, BlackRock and other investment firms, who earn fees based on a fund's levered assets.",0
"""Saba has the better argument on Section 18(i)’s requirement that all stock be 'voting stock',"" wrote Judge Paul Oetken in a rare summary judgment order on Thursday.",1
"""The court recognized Nuveen's self-serving actions for what they are: an illegal attempt to get around the 1940 Act's clear requirement of equal voting rights,"" Weinstein told Reuters.",1
Nuveen is a wholly owned subsidiary of investment firm TIAA.,0
"Saba has nominated director candidates at many prominent investment firms, arguing shareholders are harmed because the funds often trade at large discounts to their underlying holdings and have poor corporate governance.",1
The court rejected Nuveen's argument that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission effectively allowed closed-end funds to adopt so-called control share provisions.,1
Lyft Inc. has named a new legal chief as the ride-sharing company and competitor Uber Technologies Inc. continue to face litigation over its classification of drivers.,1
"Lyft disclosed in a securities filing late Wednesday that Llewellyn has replaced its longtime general counsel Kristin Sverchek, who has moved into the position of president of business affairs.",0
The coronavirus pandemic and a drop in demand led Lyft to furlough thousands of employees and reduce executive salaries.,0
"Lyft and Uber both face mounting litigation—and a complicated regulatory landscape—over their decision to classify drivers as independent contractors, rather than full-time employees.",1
"Lyft’s most recent proxy statement shows that Sverchek received nearly $3.6 million in total compensation during fiscal 2020, down from the nearly $6 million in total pay she earned from the San Francisco-based company in 2019.",0
"She has been given additional restricted stock units in the company in her new role as president of business affairs, according to Lyft.",0
Sverchek began her career as an associate at startup-focused law firm Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian.,0
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati advised Lyft on its initial public offering.,0
"Llewellyn, Lyft’s new legal chief, joined the company as a managing counsel for litigation in 2014.",1
"Prior to that role, which saw Llewellyn serve as Lyft’s first in-house litigator, she was an associate at Winston & Strawn in San Francisco.",1
"The company credited Llewellyn for building a team of litigators covering areas like consumer class actions, competition, insurance coverage disputes, intellectual property and regulatory matters.",1
"Johnson & Johnson, the consumer products and health giant that manufactured generic opioid medications, will contribute $5 billion to the settlement.",1
"Three massive drug wholesalers — AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — will pay a combined $21 billion.",0
Stein noted that most of the funds are earmarked for health care and drug treatment programs designed to ease the opioid crisis.,0
"In all, 46 states and roughly 90% of eligible local governments have signed on to the deal, according to the companies' assessment.",0
"AmerisourceBergen will pay $6.1 billion, Cardinal Health will pay $6 billion and McKesson, $7.4 billion.",0
"Drug overdoses now kill more than 100,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",0
"Joe Rice, with the firm Motley Rice, is one of the lead attorneys suing the drug industry over its alleged role in the opioid crisis.",1
"""Going into the opioid litigation, that was recognized as being a big problem that we had to fix,"" he said.",1
"According to Stein, companies have also agreed to fund a new monitoring system to prevent communities from again being flooded with high-risk medications.",0
"""It will ensure that no more communities are awash in opioids as happened over the last couple of decades.""",0
"One email shared among executives at AmerisourceBergen — made public for the first time during a state trial last year in West Virginia — disparaged people addicted to opioids, describing them as ""pillbillies"" and referring to OxyContin as ""hillbilly heroin.""",1
"That deal, if finalized, is expected to include payouts topping $6 billion.",0
"Meanwhile, opioid-related lawsuits continue in state and federal courts around the country focused largely on pharmacy chains that sold large quantities of opioid medications directly to consumers.",1
"Lawyers that represent corporations and investors said that the proposal, released earlier this week, could be a potent source of securities fraud litigation, which targets companies over alleged lies or even half-truths told to the investing public.",1
"“The plaintiffs lawyers are waiting in the wings,” said Craig Marcus, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP who advises prominent public companies.",1
"In place of voluntary sustainability reports which use handpicked metrics, companies would have to disclose in much greater detail how much carbon they emit and how they plan to address looming climate risks.",0
Observers already have noted that the new regime would require companies to expend considerable resources to craft these disclosures.,0
"That cost would be evident quickly, but private securities litigation tied to new climate disclosures represents a lurking threat that could materialize down the road.",1
Plaintiffs’ lawyers in typical cases pair with investors to sue a company over stock drops linked to issues a company didn’t adequately flag.,1
"A company might be sued, for example, if it says it has a substantial antibribery program but ends up caught in a corruption scandal.",1
The wide-ranging climate disclosures the SEC wants would up the number of avenues for a lawsuit.,1
"A wildfire in California destroys a facility, for example, and investors could claim they were misled about the company’s climate risk management.",1
Or arguably investors could sue if the company miscalculated greenhouse-gas emissions.,1
"For some companies, the SEC’s proposed rule would mandate that they determine and disclose emissions caused by supply networks and their customers in connection with their products, tricky endeavors that require assembling data many companies haven’t previously considered.",0
The proposed rule wouldn’t impact companies immediately.,0
"It has a long lead time, with some companies not required to comply until 2026, and it is almost certain to face a legal campaign to squash it.",1
Some plaintiffs’ lawyers are cautiously optimistic.,1
"“What the SEC is doing is encouraging much more accurate and complete disclosures, and you may see litigation if there are material omissions or misstatements made to investors with regard to those climate disclosures,” said Darren Robbins, whose law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP brought securities actions that last year resulted in about $1.9 billion in settlements.",1
Precision Castparts Corp. has agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit over air pollution coming from its metal parts manufacturing facility in Southeast Portland.,1
"Last week, a Multnomah County Circuit Court judge gave preliminary approval to the settlement, which stems from allegations that the metal casting facility emitted toxic metals and polluted nearby homes.",1
"The company has also spent more than $300,000 on air monitoring equipment to test for pollution in the surrounding neighborhood and will be required to install nearly $2 million in additional pollution controls at its facilities pending an additional court approval.",1
Bullseye Glass settled that case for $6.5 million.,1
Both cases emerged out of a 2016 U.S. Forest Service study of moss that revealed previously unknown levels of toxic metals in Southeast Portland’s air.,0
"Based on the outcome of that case, Preusch estimates residents affected by Precision Castparts pollution will receive about $3,500 apiece.",1
"A $12.5 million settlement fund will pay for attorneys, and the remainder of the money will be divided among residents who lived in the area affected by pollution from the facility.",1
"Information is being distributed this week to about 6,000 Southeast Portland households that are eligible to file a claim for damages in the case.",1
"In a statement, Precision Castparts said the settlement will allow the company “to resolve costly, long-term litigation.” The company manufactures metal parts for airplanes and other industrial products.",1
"To be clear, the authors do not suggest that these alternative factors should be the definitive guidelines promulgated by the USPTO.",0
"Refinements, revisions, and improvements to this proposal are both likely and welcome, especially given the collective experience and varied perspectives of the diverse PTAB community.",0
§ 314(a).,0
"Certainly, the Administrative Procedures Act provides constraints on the Director’s discretion, but (of course) those limitations are not specific to the PTAB’s institution decision.",0
"The Petitioner here did exactly what Congress envisioned in providing for inter partes reviews in the America Invents Act: upon being sued for infringement, and having received notice of the claims it was alleged to infringe, it diligently filed a Petition with the Board, seeking review of the patentability of those claims in the alternative tribunal created by the AIA. . . .",1
"The inter partes review would proceed, necessarily having a narrower scope than the infringement trial before the district court, and would resolve in an efficient manner the patentability questions so that the district court need not take them up.",1
This implicates the Small Business Inventors’ need for clear regulations promulgated lawfully by the Director that preserves and improves (not eliminates) the Director’s full powers of discretionary denial.16 ― The PTAB is increasingly refusing to institute otherwise-meritorious IPR petitions for purely procedural reasons.,0
A sample of recent institution decisions illustrates the problem....,0
"Notwithstanding the foregoing, this factor should be nearly dispositive in favor of institution for timely filed PGRs.",0
"Commentary: The petitioner should be afforded a reasonable opportunity after service of the complaint to evaluate the asserted patent and, inter alia, collect and review the prior art, consult with an expert witness, and prepare the petition and supporting declaration.",1
§ 321(c).,0

The potential for divergent district court and ITC claim construction and invalidity determinations highlights the USPTO’s role of providing a uniform patentability analysis.,1
"Further, the TC Heartland decision,22 which has resulted in the distribution of patent infringement cases in a significantly greater number of venues, increases the likelihood of divergent district court decisions regarding an asserted patent.",1

"Also, the Panel should disregard any district court or ITC invalidity allegations that would not have been permitted in the PTAB challenge.",1
"Commentary: Certainly Congress’ intent in establishing IPR and PGR reviews was to provide an alternative forum for evaluating certain patent validity (patentability) challenges, and generally to allow the petitioner with a single bite at that proverbial apple.",0
"To the extent that the PTAB proceeding will not effectively accomplish that “single bite” purpose, then the USPTO should have less interest in instituting trial.",1
"Note, however, that parties should not be able to “game” this factor by naming and/or deleting parties in the parallel district court or ITC litigation who do not substantively affect the principal infringement and invalidity allegations.",1

"Commentary: In conjunction with Factor 1, this factor assumes that most parallel district or ITC cases will have been proceeding for about 10 months at the expected date for the PTAB’s Decision on Institution (“DI”), and thus have begun (and possibly completed) the Markman stage of the litigation.",1
"But in consideration of efficiency and notice to the district court or ITC, defendants should be encouraged to seek a stay if they so desire, and they should not be penalized by the PTAB for doing so.",1
"This factor also neutralizes the impact of the district court’s or ITC’s Markman proceeding because the parties’ briefing, and the district court’s or ITC’s analysis, regarding claim construction under the common Phillips standard can be readily considered by the PTAB.",1

"Indeed, most of the salient considerations of the NHK-Fintiv factors have been incorporated into the proposed alternative factors.",0

"Accordingly, trial dates are frequently postponed, either by the Court sua sponte or in conjunction with party stipulation.24 The PTAB should not engage in such error-prone speculation, and should not make an important institution decision based on information that is speculative and very likely to become inaccurate after the PTAB issues its DI.",1
The authors appreciate that proposed Babcock-Train Factor 6 (“stage of the district court proceeding”) would also require some speculation by the Board.,1

A federal judge in Colorado has sanctioned Seyfarth Shaw and its client for misconduct during the discovery process.,1
"Senior U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson of the District of Colorado ordered the law firm and its client, the Howmedica Osteonics Corp., to pay their litigation opponent’s share of the costs of a special master appointed to oversee discovery.",1
"Howmedica Osteonics should pay half of the opponent’s special master costs for failing to preserve text messages, Jackson said in his May 10 opinion.",1
"Seyfarth should pay the other half for discovery misconduct by counsel that included “playing fast and loose” with discovery obligations, Jackson said.",1
"“This was a large, important case for both parties,” Jackson said.",1
"The case involved a contract dispute between Howmedica Osteonics and the plaintiff, a company hired to help sell Howmedica Osteonics’ medical-implant products.",1
"Jackson entered judgment for the plaintiff, ORP Surgical, ordered Howmedica Osteonics to pay $4.7 million in damages, and ordered Howmedica Osteonics to pay ORP Surgical’s attorney fees, as called for in the breached contract.",1
"“I find Stryker’s purported excuses for terminating the joint contract for ‘cause’ to be flimsy and lacking in credibility,” Jackson said.",1
"The failure to preserve text messages “was either willful misconduct or gross negligence,” Jackson said.",0
"• A Seyfarth Shaw lawyer behaved inappropriately, disruptively, uncivilly and unprofessionally in defending a Stryker recruiter during a deposition.",1
• Stryker lawyers improperly coached and insufficiently prepared their witnesses who were supposed to testify about compensation of sales reps.,1
"The witnesses “declined to answer questions about compensation and indemnification either because they were unprepared or because objections and instructions from Stryker’s counsel encouraged them to stonewall the questioner,” Jackson said.",1

The first that many companies hear about patent litigation filed by a non-practicing entity (“NPE”) is when they receive a complaint initiating litigation.,1
And the chances of being on the receiving end of NPE litigation are trending upward.,1
"The upward trend may be continuing in view of BlackBerry’s announcement in January that it divested nearly all of its non-core legacy patents to an NPE for $600 million, and assignments indicating other recent large portfolio acquisitions by NPEs such as Dominion Harbor.",0
"The first group of NPEs is the high-volume, quick-settlement plaintiffs.",1
"By and large, these NPEs are behind the recent uptick in patent litigation.",1
"For example, patent monetization company IP Edge was responsible for adding around 144 of the 525 defendants added to patent litigation in the first quarter of 2022.",1
"NPEs in this group are prolific filers, but generally pursue early settlements, often even before a responsive pleading has been filed.",1
"The second group of NPEs target fewer companies, are backed by litigation funders, and are prepared to pursue cases toward higher value resolutions or judgments.",1
"However, for defendants, these cases often hold greater risk because the NPE is prepared to drive cases forward and hold out for higher settlements.",1
"With this understanding, as soon as a complaint is received, a defendant should learn as much about the plaintiff as possible.",1
Most named plaintiff NPEs are simply shell companies for the actual NPE.,1
"So, it is important to find who is behind the litigation.",1
"Look at assignment records for the plaintiff’s patents, not just those being asserted in litigation.",1
"Search the federal court PACER system to learn where and how often the plaintiff has filed patent litigation, and how long it takes for these cases to be resolved.",1
A simple Google search will often reveal the plaintiff’s reputation for serial patent litigation and may also provide clues to the true NPE.,1
"Using this initial research, the defendant can understand the plaintiff’s level of aggressiveness and the likelihood of early resolution, and categorize the NPE accordingly.",1
"For years, the Eastern District of Texas was a major hub of NPE filing and patent litigation in general, thanks in large part to the court’s rules of procedure for patent cases.",1
"However, it remains a popular jurisdiction among NPE plaintiffs.",1
"In the last three years, the Waco division of the Western District of Texas has quickly become another popular venue for NPE plaintiffs, largely due to the appointment of Judge Alan Albright in 2018 and his adoption of patent local rules that are very similar to those in the Eastern District.",1
"Notably, in these two Texas districts, the rules drive patent litigation to trial quickly, often faster than an Inter Partes review—one common tactic for defendants to challenge the validity of patents asserted against them—before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",1
"One strategy to protect a company from NPE litigation is to stay out or move out of these districts, as some companies reportedly have done.",1
"If that is not a practical possibility, when a suit is filed by an NPE in one of these jurisdictions, consider filing a motion to transfer venue to another district where, for example, your company’s headquarters is located.",1
"Additionally, in the Western District of Texas, companies may have a physical presence in Austin, Texas.",0
"Judge Albright draws cases filed in Waco, Texas, where NPEs file the vast majority of Western District cases.",1
"If transferred, it will result in a different judge hearing the case and different patent local rules being applied.",1
"If your case will be going forward in the Eastern or the Waco division of the Western District of Texas, it is important to understand upfront that there will be challenges.",1
"For example, dispositive motions are statistically less likely to be successful.",1
"While they can be part of the litigation strategy, they should not be a centerpiece.",1
It is smart to expect that the case will proceed to trial and prepare the case for the long haul from early on.,1
Part of that long-term strategy should include working with counsel who are experienced with litigation in the jurisdiction and have demonstrated success at trial in these venues.,1
This strategy often included extensive discovery and motion practice often with little to show for the resources expended.,1
"NPEs have evolved in the years since, with strategic responses to the AIA as well as the embrace of litigation funding.",1
"From the outset, companies should consider the end game including prospects for both settlement and trial.",1
"Rather than resource-wasting motion practice in jurisdictions where such motions are likely to have little effect, a company should work with its counsel early on to identify the key weaknesses in the plaintiff’s case and understand the issues that are most likely to drive resolution.",1
"At the same time, companies that face the more serious cases should immediately begin preparing a solid trial story that will then be developed through discovery.",1
"Even when facing a high-volume NPE, one camp of defendants—wary of becoming a “corporate ATM” for NPEs—have taken a hard line against settling with NPEs.",1
"Newegg, for example, became well-known for its zero-tolerance policy in the mid-2010s.",0
"The Newegg approach, while effective at reducing the NPE threat over the long term, requires both the stomach to fight litigation all the way to trial and the consistency to follow this strategy over the course of multiple cases.",1
"In addition, while it is common for joint defense groups to form among multiple defendants facing similar claims from the same NPE, this type of defendant will often need to go it alone while most other defendants settle.",1
"Given recent trends, we are in another expansion of NPE litigation with far more investment behind this uptick than prior waves.",1

"(Reuters) - InterDigital Inc, a developer of digital mobile and video technology, said on Tuesday it has entered a worldwide patent licensing agreement with China’s Huawei Technologies Ltd, and that the companies have settled all litigation against each other.",1
"In a regulatory filing, InterDigital said the licensing agreement runs through 2023, and covers royalties from the sale of some of Huawei’s 3G, 4G and 5G wireless telecommunications products.",0
InterDigital said the companies have also ended more than 15 months of litigation in China and the United Kingdom.,1
"Huawei had sued InterDigital in January 2019 in the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court in China, claiming that the Wilmington, Delaware-based company was licensing its patents on unfair terms, according to a separate regulatory filing.",1
"InterDigital countered in December 2019 with its own action before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, accusing Huawei of infringing five patents related to industry standards for 3G, 4G and 5G telecommunications.",1
"Talks to renew an earlier Huawei license had broken down, and the UK court would serve as a “neutral venue” to address the dispute, InterDigital said at the time.",1
InterDigital said a typical royalty might be $1.15 on a 3G or 4G smartphone that costs $500.,0
Terms to resolve the disputes were not disclosed.,1
