"BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) today announced that following an investment grade issuer rating from S&P Global Ratings (S&P) – the third it has received from credit rating agencies – the company now has its first-ever full investment grade rating.",1
This follows the company securing a Baa3 rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s and a BBB- rating with a positive outlook from Fitch.,1
"This full investment grade rating comes as a result of T-Mobile’s successful operational and financial performance, which is consistently demonstrated through strong subscriber growth and the company’s ability to translate that into increasing free cash flow.",1
"“Achieving a full investment grade rating is an important milestone for T-Mobile that reflects the leading credit rating agencies’ positive outlook on our Un-carrier leadership strategy that is rooted in an unwavering focus on putting customers first,” said Peter Osvaldik, T-Mobile chief financial officer.",1
"T-Mobile’s customers benefit from its unmatched combination of value and quality, unwavering obsession with offering them the best possible service experience and undisputable drive for disruption that creates competition and innovation in wireless and beyond.",0

"FORNEBU, Norway, Aug. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Scope Ratings has assigned an investment grade rating of BBB-/Stable to Aker ASA.",1
"In the rating report, Scope notes that the rating is driven by Aker's low leverage and its controlled cost coverage, balancing cash inflow and outflows, in addition to that the liquidity of Aker's assets further benefits the rating.",0
"This stock exchange announcement was published by Laila Hop, Paralegal, Aker ASA, on August 17, 2022, at 06:58 CEST.",0
"Anyone can invest in BDCs, as they are public companies traded on major stock exchanges.",0
"However, many of these bonds are now rebounding and I have started making purchases of shorter and mid duration maturities.",0
Brokerages express the trading prices as a percentage of the face value.,0
"For more information on examples of how to trade bonds using CUSIPs and limit orders, please see the following link.",0
"Therefore, a company with a high asset coverage ratio is considered less risky than a company with a low asset coverage ratio.",0
"Also called the times-interest-earned ratio, this ratio is used by creditors and prospective lenders to assess the risk of lending capital to a firm.",0
"When a company's interest coverage ratio is only 1.5 times or lower, its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable.",0
"With the additional $500 million in low-cost fixed rate notes that we issued in 2021, as of the end of the first quarter, 81% of Main Street's outstanding debt obligations maintain fixed interest rates.",0
"On the other hand, as of the end of the first quarter, approximately 73% of our debt investments bear interest at floating rates with the majority subject to contractual interest rate floors and with a weighted average fall of approximately 105 basis points.",0
"However, MAIN's dividend yield has been trending lower, especially after excluding the March 2020 market disruption.",0
"As mentioned earlier, I have started purchasing shorter and mid duration bonds with relatively higher yields (for similar durations).",0
This means that projected earnings for Q3 and Q4 will probably need to be increased.,0

"Furthermore, FSK's portfolio is generally overweight more defensive sectors, with its top five sectors being software, capital goods, healthcare, commercial and professional services, and real estate.",0
"MAIN's portfolio consists of 69% senior secured debt and 73% of its debt investments are floating rate, meaning that 58.6% of the total investment portfolio benefits from rising interest rates.",0
Non-accruals were very low as of 3/31/22 at just 0.6% at fair value.,0
"FSK's is larger and therefore better diversified, has significantly more exposure to debt investments, and is better positioned to see income increase from rising interest rates.",0
"However, given that we have a separate section for that, we will just stick with objective evaluation of the numbers here.",0
"As a result, we are simply going to say here that we think that FSK's total recent dividend payout of 12.6% more than doubles MAIN's 6.2% payout and therefore believe that FSK's margin of safety for paying out a higher yield than MAIN does over the course of a fiscal year is sufficiently large to give it a more attractive overall dividend.",0
"Nevertheless, MAIN still wins the track record comparison without a doubt.",0
"Meanwhile, its portfolio is more aggressively positioned than FSK's is.",0
"Additionally, its recent changes designed to improve efficiencies and unlock shareholder value via buybacks and aggressive dividend payouts along with its deep discount to NAV make it a very compelling buy here.",0
"Meanwhile, MAIN's heavier equity exposure and massive premium to NAV force us to rate it a Hold, even though we certainly have regard for its impressive track record.",0

IShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is a solid choice for exposure to the investment-grade corporate-bond market.,1
"But its portfolio is not fully representative of its opportunity set, as its index excludes bonds with less than three years remaining until maturity, and there are cheaper alternatives.",0
"LQD tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Investment Grade Index, which includes investment-grade corporate bonds with more than three years remaining until maturity.",1
The three-year cutoff excludes a sizable portion of the corporate-bond market and results in a portfolio focused on intermediate- and long-term bonds.,0
"Reflecting the composition of the market, the strategy maintains a fair amount of credit risk.",0
Approximately 90% of its portfolio is invested in bonds rated A and BBB.,1
"Roughly 50% of the fund's assets are invested in BBB rated debt, which matches the corporate-bond Morningstar Category average.",0
"Its average effective duration is approximately 9.0 years, while the average effective duration of the corporate-bond category is approximately 6.5 years.",0
"However, given its focus on longer-date issues, the fund courts more interest-rate risk.",0
"This helped its performance during the trailing 10 years through February 2020, a period in when interest rates were generally declining.",0
"It performed worse than the category average by over 150 basis points during the first three quarters of 2018, when the yield on the 10-year Treasury increased from by 68 basis points (from 2.46% to 3.14%).",0
"While the downgrade risk of BBB rated issuances is generally low, the strategy would suffer should some of these issuances be downgraded to junk because it is unable to own below-investment-grade issuances.",0
"The strategy's BBB rated debt exposure is on par with the category average, so many other funds would also be seeking to offload these issues, thereby raising their supply in the market.",0
"For example, the ICE Bank of America BBB OAS Spread widened by 3.55% during the onset of the coronavirus crisis between Feb. 20 and March 23, 2020, and the fund fell 14.83%.",0
"But this broad market-value-weighted portfolio relies on the market's collective wisdom to assess the relative value of its holdings, effectively betting that the market is offering a fair deal.",0
But larger issuers tend to be larger companies with the necessary resources to effectively service their debt.,0
The market knows what the future cash flows of investment-grade bonds will be with greater certainty than stocks.,1
"The strategy is one of the cheapest funds in its category, which should give it a durable edge.",0
"This is a sound approach because it is cost-effective, it promotes low turnover, and the market does a decent job pricing these bonds.",0
"This strategy employs representative sampling to track the performance of the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Investment Grade Index, which includes investment-grade corporate bonds with more than three years until maturity.",1
"Qualifying bonds must have at least $750 million in outstanding face value, tilting the strategy to the most liquid issues, which are easier to track and help to mitigate transaction costs.",0
The index is rebalanced monthly.,0
"It tracks the ICE BofAML US Corporate Index, which includes liquidity-screened U.S.-dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate debt with at least one year until maturity.",1
"Silver-rated SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF (SPIB) (0.07% expense ratio) tracks the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate US Corporate Index, which includes U.S.-dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate bonds with between one and 10 years until maturity.",1
"This strategy carries less interest-rate risk than LQD because of its exclusion of issues maturing after 10 years, which should allow it to provide better protection during periods of rising interest rates.",0

Levy blamed the government’s abandonment of targets needed to cut debt for Fitch’s decision.,0
"The real currency and dollar-denominated bonds tumbled amid forced selling after the downgrade, which came just three months after Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s rating to junk, further clouding the outlook for an economy reeling from its sharpest downturn in a quarter-century.",0

"Ford's return to investment-grade status in 2012, following the 2008-2009 economic crisis, was a hard-won goal for the company.",1
"But with this downgrade, 2 of the 3 major credit-rating agencies now rate Ford below the BBB level -- meaning that the company's credit rating is now, technically speaking, junk.",0
"The decision to downgrade Ford Motor Co. investment grade to speculative grade reflects that the company's credit metrics and competitive position became borderline for the investment-grade rating prior to the coronavirus outbreak, and the expected downturn in light-vehicle demand made it unlikely that Ford would maintain the required metrics.",0
