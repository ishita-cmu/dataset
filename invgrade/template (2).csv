Moody's Rating,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526282-strong-return-on-main-street-investment-grade-bond,Fixed 6.5% Return On Main Street's Investment Grade Bond (NYSE:MAIN),"ChunumunuQuick Introduction To Business Development Companies (""BDCs"")Business development companies (""BDCs"") invest shareholder capital in privately owned, small- and medium-sized U.S. companies. BDCs aim to generate income and capital gains when the companies they invest in are sold, much like venture capital or private equity funds. Anyone can invest in BDCs, as they are public companies traded on major stock exchanges.BDC BuzzInvestment Grade BDC Bonds/NotesMany BDCs have investment grade (""IG"") bonds/notes for lower-risk investors that do not mind lower yields/returns. Thanks to the recent declines in fixed income, the traditional bond market is now offering some excellent values, especially in the BDC sector, and I will discuss over the coming weeks. However, many of these bonds are now rebounding and I have started making purchases of shorter and mid duration maturities.Traditional bonds do not trade on stock exchanges but are available through your brokerage using CUSIP numbers with a face/maturity value of $1,000. These bonds pay interest semi-annually with a pro-rated interest payment on the purchase date. Brokerages express the trading prices as a percentage of the face value. As shown below, MAINs 2026 bond is currently priced at $87.79, which implies a current value of $877.90 for each bond. For more information on examples of how to trade bonds using CUSIPs and limit orders, please see the following link.Most BDC bonds have credit ratings from Moodys and/or S&P and so far, no BDC has ever defaulted for the reasons discussed last week in:As shown below, BDCs are highly regulated with plenty of protections for investors in the common stock and debt obligations, such as the amount of leverage (asset coverage ratios discussed later), asset diversification, and having a portfolio that can ""generate sufficient cash flows to pay interest as well as dividends to equity investors junior to debt holders"":ARCC Presentation MAINMAIN Street Capitals Investment Grade BondsMain Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) has three investment grade bonds (CUSIPs: 56035LAE4, 56035LAD6, 56035LAC8) that are investment grade rated by both S&P and Fitch at BBB- with a stable outlook reflecting:Main Streets portfolio focus on senior debt investments, strong portfolio diversification, solid track record in credit and equity investments, above-average asset coverage cushion, consistent operating performance, experienced management team and strong funding flexibility with demonstrated access to the public debt and equity markets.""Source: Main Street Announces Investment Grade Rating (July 14, 2022)MAIN PresentationAs discussed in the previously linked article, the ""Asset Coverage Ratio"" is a financial metric that measures how well a company can repay its debts by selling or liquidating its assets. The higher the asset coverage ratio, the more times a company can cover its debt. Therefore, a company with a high asset coverage ratio is considered less risky than a company with a low asset coverage ratio. BDCs are required to maintain minimum asset coverage of 150% providing strong protection to bondholders, which is one of the reasons that no publicly traded BDC has ever filed for bankruptcy nor defaulted on bond holders in the history of the sector.As of March 31, 2022, MAINs asset coverage ratio was 227% as shown below:BDC BuzzThe ""Interest Expense Coverage"" ratio is used to see how well a company can pay the interest on outstanding debt. Also called the times-interest-earned ratio, this ratio is used by creditors and prospective lenders to assess the risk of lending capital to a firm. A higher coverage ratio is better, although the ideal ratio may vary by industry. When a companys interest coverage ratio is only 1.5 times or lower, its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable.MAINs interest expense coverage ratio has historically averaged around 4.0 times, as shown below:BDC BuzzInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2022, around 73% of MAINs portfolio debt investments bore interest at variable rates, 93% of which were subject to contractual minimum interest rates and only 19% of borrowings were also at variable rates. Theres a good chance that many BDCs will be increasing dividends over the coming quarters, especially as the Fed will likely increase rates by another 75 points today, driving a significant improvement in this analysis for most BDCsOne additional item that I wanted to touch on is the impact of rising interest rates. With the additional $500 million in low-cost fixed rate notes that we issued in 2021, as of the end of the first quarter, 81% of Main Streets outstanding debt obligations maintain fixed interest rates. This mitigates our exposure to higher interest expense during a rising interest rate environment. On the other hand, as of the end of the first quarter, approximately 73% of our debt investments bear interest at floating rates with the majority subject to contractual interest rate floors and with a weighted average fall of approximately 105 basis points. As a result, future increases in interest rates will result in increases to interest income, which will exceed the increases to interest expense.""Source: MAIN Investor CallBDC BuzzCurrent Yields For Common Stock and BondsIn May 2022, MAIN reaffirmed its regular monthly dividends of $0.215 per share for Q3 2022, plus a supplemental cash dividend of $0.075 per share.FidelityMAIN is considered a safer BDC, which is why it has a lower-than-average dividend yield currently around 6.5% compared to an average of around 7.3% over the last 5 years. However, MAINs dividend yield has been trending lower, especially after excluding the March 2020 market disruption.BDC BuzzMAINs 2026 bond is trading at a significant discount, driving a yield-to-maturity of 6.5% which is above the current dividend yield from its common stock. Also, over the next four years, this bond will slowly appreciate toward par of $1,000 and capital gains will account for a good portion of the yield-to-maturity driving a lower tax liability.FINRAThe following chart and table are from the BDC Google Sheets showing MAINs bonds. As mentioned earlier, I have started purchasing shorter and mid duration bonds with relatively higher yields (for similar durations).Over the coming weeks, I will cover many other BDCs listed below, including their asset and interest expense coverage ratios:BDC BuzzConclusion - Risk-Adjusted ReturnsGiven the uncertainty of upcoming returns from equity/stock positions, I would suggest that investors take this opportunity to lock in a 6.5% annualized return, at far lower risk, over the next four years. MAINs stock price is likely overbought at these levels and its relative strength index (""RSI"") is currently 70, which is typically a firm indicator:FidelityThe key risk to the bondholder is a default by MAIN, which is extremely remote given the companys history/performance:MAIN is one of the best-of-breed BDCs with a long track record of returns through previous market cyclesAsset coverage of debt is 227% and by regulation must be at least 150%Interest expense coverage has averaged around 4.0 times, which is much higher than most companiesMAINs bonds are rated investment grade by both S&P and FitchNo publicly traded BDC has ever filed for bankruptcy and impaired debt holders in the history of the sectorA 6.5% locked-in return for the next four years is attractive in an environment of high market volatility and uncertainty of returnsUpcoming BDC Reporting DatesBDCs have begun reporting Q2 2022 results and Im expecting improved results relative to Q1 2022, including higher dividend coverage and maintained credit quality but slightly lower NAVs (similar to Q1 2022) simply due to widening credit spreads (not credit quality related). Theres a good chance that many BDCs will be increasing dividends, especially as the Fed will likely increase rates by another 75 points today, driving a significant improvement in the Interest Rate Sensitivity analysis for most BDCs (similar to the previous quarter). This means that projected earnings for Q3 and Q4 will probably need to be increased. Also, most BDCs have been positioning for a recession for a while now and COVID provided a portfolio stress test which most BDCs took advantage of the market rebound to rotate into more secured positions with higher cash flow coverage preparing for higher interest rates and/or an economic slowdown/recession.Over the coming weeks, I will cover many other BDCs listed below, including their asset and interest expense coverage ratios:"

Main Street: Better Investment Grade High Yield Buy (NYSE:FSK),"adaaskBoth FS KKR (NYSE:FSK) and Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) have investment grade (BBB- Stable from S&P) credit ratings, vaulting them into the upper echelon of quality Business Development Companies (i.e., BDCs) (BIZD). Both also happen to offer mouthwatering dividend yields, with FSK boasting a mouthwatering 12.6% dividend yield and MAIN offering a juicy 6.2% dividend yield.In this article, we will compare them side by side and offer our take on which one is a better buy.Balance SheetAs was already stated, both FSK and MAIN have the same investment grade credit rating and outlook (FSK has a Baa3 rating with a Stable outlook from Moodys and MAIN has a BBB- rating with a Stable outlook from S&P), which puts them on similar footing in terms of perceived risk and access to capital.FSK has $2.6 billion in total liquidity (~17% of its enterprise value) with a leverage ratio of 1.12x. 47.4% of FSKs total outstanding debt is floating rate as of the end of Q1.MAIN, meanwhile, has $535 million in total liquidity (~11.2% of its enterprise value) and a leverage ratio of under 1x. 18.5% of its total outstanding debt is floating rate as of the end of Q1.While both appear to be in solid shape and FSKs liquidity position seems stronger, MAIN seems to have the stronger balance sheet overall with lower leverage and much less floating interest rate exposure.Investment PortfolioFSKs portfolio consists of 69% senior secured debt and 87% of its debt investments are floating rate, meaning that nearly 80% of the total investment portfolio benefits from rising interest rates. Furthermore, FSKs portfolio is generally overweight more defensive sectors, with its top five sectors being software, capital goods, healthcare, commercial and professional services, and real estate. Non-accruals were very low as of 3/31/22 at just 1.5% at fair value.MAINs portfolio consists of 69% senior secured debt and 73% of its debt investments are floating rate, meaning that 58.6% of the total investment portfolio benefits from rising interest rates. Furthermore, MAINs portfolio is generally overweight more defensive sectors, with its top five sectors being commercial and professional services, machinery, capital goods, software, and distributors. Non-accruals were very low as of 3/31/22 at just 0.6% at fair value.Both portfolios have their strengths. FSKs is larger and therefore better diversified, has significantly more exposure to debt investments, and is better positioned to see income increase from rising interest rates. Meanwhile, MAIN has a lower non-accrual rate (though it is not quite as good as it first appears given that it has less exposure to debt, which is the only investment class that can go on non-accrual status) and potentially better growth potential given its greater exposure to equity.It is also worth noting that MAIN has outperformed FSK over the years:Data by YChartsWhile it is extremely close, we are going to give a slight edge to FSK here, though we also recognize that MAIN has a tremendous track record. However, given that we have a separate section for that, we will just stick with objective evaluation of the numbers here. Given that FSK has much greater exposure to floating rate interest rates, is better diversified, and has greater exposure to debt relative than equity, we favor FSKs portfolio in the current climate.DividendThis section is not entirely relevant to the comparison as FSK implements a varying dividend policy by paying out nearly all of its earnings each quarter, whereas MAIN pursues a progressive monthly dividend policy where it supports its base dividend and tries to grow it over time. As a result, we are simply going to say here that we think that FSKs total recent dividend payout of 12.6% more than doubles MAINs 6.2% payout and therefore believe that FSKs margin of safety for paying out a higher yield than MAIN does over the course of a fiscal year is sufficiently large to give it a more attractive overall dividend.Track RecordAs we already discussed in a previous section, MAINs track record is convincingly superior to FSKs. However, there are some caveats to that superior performance. For example, this outperformance was largely facilitated by an expanding P/B ratio for MAIN and a shrinking P/B ratio for FSK as well as a major equity bull market, which provided outsized benefits to MAIN:Data by YChartsAdditionally, FSK has gone through several changes over the years which are expected to improve its performance moving forward, including a merger about 13 months ago which has improved the BDCs leverage ratio, unlocked synergies and efficiencies, and prompted management to institute a buyback program.Nevertheless, MAIN still wins the track record comparison without a doubt.ValuationFSK wins the valuation comparison with flying colors. Not only is its dividend yield more than twice that of MAINs, but MAIN currently trades at a whopping 58.25% premium to NAV while FSK trades at the largest discount of investment grade BDCs with a 24.95% discount to NAV. When you consider that FSKs portfolio is arguably as conservatively positioned - if not more so than MAINs - and also benefits from parental support from the credit arm of one of the top alternative asset managers in the world (KKR (KKR)), this valuation gap seems unreasonably large.Investor TakeawayUnsurprisingly, this comes down to a competition between track record and value. MAIN has a stronger balance sheet and a vastly superior track record. Meanwhile, its portfolio is more aggressively positioned than FSKs is. As we head into a recessionary environment, it becomes increasingly important to account for the support FSK receives from KKR, its greater diversification, and its more defensive portfolio positioning. Additionally, its recent changes designed to improve efficiencies and unlock shareholder value via buybacks and aggressive dividend payouts along with its deep discount to NAV make it a very compelling buy here. In fact, we rate it a Strong Buy and it is one of our top BDC picks at High Yield Investor. Meanwhile, MAINs heavier equity exposure and massive premium to NAV force us to rate it a Hold, even though we certainly have regard for its impressive track record."
Moody's Rating,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524126-fs-kkr-vs-main-street-better-investment-grade-high-yield-buy,A Solid Choice for Exposure to the Investment-Grade Corporate-Bond Market,"IShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is a solid choice for exposure to the investment-grade corporate-bond market. The funds fee is low, and it harnesses the markets collective wisdom about the relative value of each security. But its portfolio is not fully representative of its opportunity set, as its index excludes bonds with less than three years remaining until maturity, and there are cheaper alternatives. It earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Bronze.LQD tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Investment Grade Index, which includes investment-grade corporate bonds with more than three years remaining until maturity. The three-year cutoff excludes a sizable portion of the corporate-bond market and results in a portfolio focused on intermediate- and long-term bonds. The index is weighted by market value, tilting the portfolio toward the largest, most liquid issues.Reflecting the composition of the market, the strategy maintains a fair amount of credit risk. It heavily tilts toward the lower end of the investment-grade spectrum. Approximately 90% of its portfolio is invested in bonds rated A and BBB. Roughly 50% of the funds assets are invested in BBB rated debt, which matches the corporate-bond Morningstar Category average.The portfolio courts more interest-rate risk than most of its category peers. Its average effective duration is approximately 9.0 years, while the average effective duration of the corporate-bond category is approximately 6.5 years. The fund will likely underperform its category peers during periods of rising interest rates as a result and fare relatively better when interest rates fall.Fundamental ViewReflective of its opportunity set, the strategys exposure largely mirrors its corporate-bond category peers. However, given its focus on longer-date issues, the fund courts more interest-rate risk. Its average effective duration is approximately 2.5 years longer than the category average. This helped its performance during the trailing 10 years through February 2020, a period in when interest rates were generally declining. However, the additional interest-rate sensitivity will likely hurt the funds performance during periods of rising interest rates. It performed worse than the category average by over 150 basis points during the first three quarters of 2018, when the yield on the 10-year Treasury increased from by 68 basis points (from 2.46% to 3.14%).Approximately half of the funds assets have a credit rating of BBB, the lowest possible rating for investment-grade debt. While the downgrade risk of BBB rated issuances is generally low, the strategy would suffer should some of these issuances be downgraded to junk because it is unable to own below-investment-grade issuances. The fund would be required to liquidate these issues, and the forced selling would likely result in the fund trading at a large discount. The strategys BBB rated debt exposure is on par with the category average, so many other funds would also be seeking to offload these issues, thereby raising their supply in the market.Additionally, given its focus on BBB rated issuances, the strategy will suffer during periods of widening credit spreads. For example, the ICE Bank of America BBB OAS Spread widened by 3.55% during the onset of the coronavirus crisis between Feb. 20 and March 23, 2020, and the fund fell 14.83%. During periods of weakening business conditions, credit spreads widen as the market requires more compensation for the additional risk, and safer securities tend to outperform lower-rated securities.But this broad market-value-weighted portfolio relies on the markets collective wisdom to assess the relative value of its holdings, effectively betting that the market is offering a fair deal. There are some criticisms of market-value-weighting bond index funds, most notably the idea that assigning larger weightings to more heavily indebted issuers seems illogical. But larger issuers tend to be larger companies with the necessary resources to effectively service their debt.More on This Topic A Gold-Rated Fund for Broad TIPS ExposureIn the fixed-income market, risk and reward are closely related. The market knows what the future cash flows of investment-grade bonds will be with greater certainty than stocks. Accordingly, there is less room to find an informational edge, and it would be difficult to construct a bond portfolio with market-beating returns without taking additional risk.The strategy is one of the cheapest funds in its category, which should give it a durable edge. It builds on its expense ratio advantage by mitigating transaction costs and market-value-weighting its holdings, favoring the most-liquid bonds in the market, which also tend to be the cheapest to trade.Portfolio ConstructionThis portfolio provides exposure to a broad set of investment-grade corporate bonds, free-riding on the collective wisdom of investors through market-value weighting. This is a sound approach because it is cost-effective, it promotes low turnover, and the market does a decent job pricing these bonds. However, the fund is not truly representative of its opportunity set as it excludes bonds with less than three years remaining until maturity.This strategy employs representative sampling to track the performance of the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Investment Grade Index, which includes investment-grade corporate bonds with more than three years until maturity. Qualifying bonds must have at least $750 million in outstanding face value, tilting the strategy to the most liquid issues, which are easier to track and help to mitigate transaction costs. Bonds are weighted by their market value, subject to a 3% issuer cap. The index is rebalanced monthly.FeesThe strategy has an expense ratio of 0.15%, ranking in the categorys second quartile. While cheap, there are a handful of market-value-weighted funds charging slightly less.AlternativesSilver-rated iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (USIG) (0.06% expense ratio) offers more than LQD for less. It tracks the ICE BofAML US Corporate Index, which includes liquidity-screened U.S.-dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate debt with at least one year until maturity. This strategy offers greater exposure to the investment-grade corporate-bond market than LQD, as it does not exclude issues with less than three years until maturity, and it is 9 basis points cheaper.Silver-rated SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF (SPIB) (0.07% expense ratio) tracks the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate US Corporate Index, which includes U.S.-dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate bonds with between one and 10 years until maturity. This strategy carries less interest-rate risk than LQD because of its exclusion of issues maturing after 10 years, which should allow it to provide better protection during periods of rising interest rates."

Moody's Rating,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-12/greece-eyes-return-to-investment-grade-zone-in-early-2023,Futu Announces Investment Grade Rating from S&P Global Ratings,"HONG KONG, June 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Futu Holdings Limited (“Futu” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: FUTU), a leading tech-driven online brokerage and wealth management platform in China, today announced S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) has assigned an investment grade long-term issuer credit rating “BBB-” to the Company. The outlook on the long-term rating is stable. A “bbb” GCP (group credit profile) has also been assigned. The rating on Futu reflects the Company’s leading market position in the Hong Kong brokerage market, strong capitalization with solid financing standing, and prudent risk controls.Futu is the first online broker in the Asia-Pacific region to have obtained international rating, and the first Hong Kong-based broker to have obtained standalone investment grade issuer rating, with its “bbb” GCP being the highest grade GCP/SACP (standalone credit profile) that S&P has assigned to securities firms in Greater China.According to S&P, Futu has good market presence in Hong Kong as a retail-focused online broker, and is well-placed to take advantage of the brand recognition to expand overseas market such as US and Singapore. Despite the current reliance on brokerage, Futu is striving to develop new business segments including wealth management, enterprise services, and diversify revenue sources, geographic reach, product categories and client base. Futu’s rating is well-positioned by its strong RAC (risk-adjusted capital), and S&P anticipates that Futu will sustain the capital adequacy to support its rapid growth. Futu’s funding sources can satisfy its funding needs thanks to the large collateral pool and prudent credit policies, and the company will pay more attention to the diversification of funding channels in the future.

Fiscal overperformance and cash management strategy in 2021 led to liquid cash reserves remaining very high, currently around 41 billion euros.”Finance Minister Christos Staikouras greeted the news stating that “this is a particularly positive development, and the acknowledgment of the progress and the prospects of the economy. The upgrade sends the message that the Greek economy heads steadily to the right direction, even under the current adverse conditions, creating a clear and realistic path toward obtaining investment grade in 2023.”For DBRS Morningstar, “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine looks set to shave off around one percentage point from this year’s GDP growth.It went on to note that the ECB last December signaled its support to Greek government bonds. Greek banks continue to make significant progress in reducing nonperforming loans (NPLs) to single digits, even with some new asset quality deterioration, it said.“The Stable trend reflects DBRS Morningstar’s view that Greece’s longer term economic prospects appear to be considerably strengthened by governance, investments, exports and reforms, underpinning public sector debt sustainability. DBRS Morningstar views that several credit uncertainties remain – the global economic implications of the situation in Ukraine; asset quality of the financial sector; and the extent to which the ECB will provide support to Greek bonds in a situation of market disruption,” the agency pointed out.“Greece’s ratings are underpinned by euro area membership. Greece is one of six European Union member states with EU adopted plans that include grants and loans. Moreover, the country is one of five member states to submit a first payment request to the European Commission that should release the first disbursement of €3.6 billion, probably in April. Around €70 billion of funds from the Next Generation EU financial instrument and the Multiannual Financial Framework are available in total. Greece’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Greece 2.0) consists of reforms that will likely boost inclusive growth and investment narrowing the investment gap between Greece and its euro area peers,” the company added."
Moody's Rating,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/tesla-inches-toward-blue-chip-status-with-moody-s-credit-upgrade,Netflix likely to upgrade from junk status to investment-grade status,"Netflix Inc. is edging closer to investment-grade status, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, amid a wave of credit upgrades in the past year.The streaming video company may see an upgrade from junk status by Moody’s Investors Service, which would be the second grader to take the company to investment grade, according to credit analysts Stephen Flynn and Suborna Panja. The pandemic has boosted Netflix’s profit as homebound people have spent more time watching streaming video services.A Moody’s upgrade would make much of Netflix’s $16 billion equivalent of bonds eligible for Bloomberg’s high-grade indexes, after S&P Global Ratings upgraded the company in October. Netflix could also gain high-grade status if Fitch Ratings, which currently does not grade the company, begins coverage with a blue-chip rating. Representatives for Netflix didn’t immediately return a request for comment.Companies that leave junk status and become investment grade, known as rising stars, can often get financing from a deeper pool of borrowers at lower rates. There could be another $169 billion wave of such shifts by 2023, Bloomberg Intelligence wrote in December, as companies show more signs of recovery from the pandemic.Companies have already been getting upgraded out of high-yield status -- Dell Technologies Inc., for example, was lifted to investment-grade status by two firms in September. These rising stars come after the pandemic clobbered the global economy in 2020, triggering a wave of downgrades to junk that year.Rising stars often sell high-grade bonds soon after they are upgraded, and tend to perform better than the broader market, according to Yuri Seliger, Bank of America Corp. credit strategist.“Rising stars should be bought as soon as possible,"" he wrote in December.Netflix’s credit profile has improved in recent years. The company borrowed billions of dollars to fund the production of TV shows and movies like “Stranger Things"" and “Don’t Look Up"" as well as licenses for existing programming for its popular streaming service. As its customer base has grown, its needs for outside cash has dwindled. The company has said it won’t need to borrow much money in the future.In 2022, Netflix expects to generate positive free cash flow after being about breakeven in 2021, Flynn and Panja wrote. S&P ranks the global streaming services leader BBB, two steps above high yield. Moody’s has a Ba1 rating, just one step shy of investment grade, with a positive outlook, after upgrading the company in April.The company at the end of the third quarter had debt equal to about 1.1 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, a level typically associated with investment-grade ratings. In 2019, that ratio was closer to 3.2 times.It also has “ample liquidity,"" Flynn wrote in a separate note, with $7.5 billion in cash and an undrawn revolving credit line of $1 billion. Netflix’s ratio of free cash flow-to-debt, meanwhile, could rebound over the next two years and mimic levels of high-grade media companies such as ViacomCBS, he wrote.Netflix isn’t likely to issue bonds until the potential $400 million refinancing of its 5.75% notes due in March 2024, Flynn wrote, assuming no major acquisitions. The company’s 5.875% notes due 2028 were trading around 120 cents on the dollar on Monday, according to Trace bond trading data. Netflix is expected to next report quarterly earnings on January 20.“Netflix’s impressive credit metrics are improving, helped by a massive liquidity war chest,"" Flynn and Panja wrote. “The metrics compare favorably with high-grade-rated media peers, to say nothing about its vastly superior growth rate.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

And that has made them more attractive to fixed income investors, including those who’ve shunned them in the recent past, including Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Capital.Investment grade corporate bonds have stumbled because interest rate risk rather than credit risk has been driving the current moves. Investors have been more worried about rate hikes and the previously puny yields of investment grade corporates than they have about their credit risk.‘It’s all been about rates,’ said Robert Cohen, director of global developed credit at DoubleLine, noting that floating rate loans along with their junk bond cousins have also held up better than investment grade corporates.If the Federal Reserve does engineer a recession by hiking rates, that could be worse for both high yield bonds and bank loans, which need a robust economy to avoid default.Fading the trade‘Investment grade credit requires less growth to perform than high yield,’ said Cohen, surmising that investment grade could be poised to outperform in a weakening economy.‘We’ve moved to neutral on bank loans and CLOs [securitizations of bank loans], while we were overweight last year. We didn’t see growth concerns on the horizon, and we saw rate concerns. . . .[but] now our outlook is to continue to fade the [floating rate/bank loan] trade,’ he added.DoubleLine had been bearish on investment grade corporate coming into the year. Founder and CEO Gundlach has spoken frequently about tight spreads and paltry yields on these bonds. The firm’s stance has now softened. ‘As we started to go through this period of re-setting rates in the Treasury market, [we’ve also] re-set the relationship in investment grade. Now yields are higher,’ Cohen said.Despite fading the bank loan trade, Cohen favors going somewhat down the credit scale within the investment grade universe. He explained that the 4-year bonds of large banks such as Citigroup and JP Morgan are fetching close to 4%, while one would have to purchase a 13-year Microsoft bond – with much more duration risk - to achieve a similar yield.If a little credit risk is better than interest rate risk in the investment grade universe, the opposite is true in high yield.There, Cohen said, it is better to ‘hug the BB sector,’ which is the highest junk rating. There’s less of a need to go down the credit scale to generate reasonable yield in high yield currently. It’s ‘way too early to talk about CCCs, which are idiosyncratic and live on their own credit risk. If growth slows, CCCs will be at most risk.’Traditionally in the high yield universe, defaults have been over 4% annually, while recoveries have adjusted that to a loss rate somewhat over 2%. But those are average annual numbers, and from year to year the numbers can vary considerably. Cohen said the assumptions for the future of defaults, recoveries, and ultimate loss rates are the subject of great debate at DoubleLine currently.The most recent portfolio the firm has published for its DoubleLine Core Fixed Income fund (DBLFX) shows 17.1% exposure to investment grade corporates and 4.3% exposure to high yield corporates as of the end of April.A dissenting viewNot everyone is turning sanguine about investment grade, however. Carl Kaufman, manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund (OSTIX), a high yield strategy, thinks investment grade bonds could come under further pressure from rate hikes.In that view, however, he agrees with Cohen from DoubleLine that rates have been affecting investment grade corporates adversely.‘We know we have at least two 50 basis point [hikes] coming in a few months. The market always seems to act surprised when it happens, so I think you might get a few legs down in the investment grade universe,’ he said.Within the high yield universe, Kaufman took a different stance to Cohen. There he’s avoiding BB-rated bonds because he ‘[doesn’t] want rate sensitivity.’ Lower rated bonds tend to pay higher yields, and that can lower their duration risk.But neither is Kaufman buying CCC-rated bonds because ‘we’re trying to avoid companies with a lot of leverage.’Kaufman tends to like companies that make things or are efficient users of capital, and that latter criterion applies to some wholesale lenders and mortgage companies, in his opinion.He added that he was nonplussed with the Fed’s reaction to recent spikes in the consumer price index.‘[This is] the worst inflation in 40 years, but there’s no special meeting, no balance sheet reduction [from the Fed]. Its sense of urgency underwhelms us,’ he said."

Phill Magakoe/Gallo Images via Getty ImagesSouth Africa has lost its last remaining major investment-grade sovereign credit rating, as existing economic weakness is compounded by the potential impact of the global coronavirus pandemic. South Africa has no investment-grade sovereign credit rating from any of the major ratings agencies for the first time since its return to global markets in 1994. Moodys announced on Friday that it had cut the countrys last investment-grade rating to ""junk,"" sending the Rand to an all-time low of below 18 to the dollar. Standard & Poors and Fitch both downgraded Africas most industrialized economy to sub-investment grade in 2017. In its release, Moodys cited structurally weak growth, limited capacity to stimulate the economy and an ""inexorable rise"" in government debt over the medium term as key reasons for the downgrade and maintenance of its ""negative"" outlook.The situation has been exacerbated by the expected economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Confirmed cases in South Africa have now exceeded 1,300, though the government is hoping that drastic early lockdown measures will prevent the exponential spread seen in Europe and the U.S. ""Unreliable electricity supply, persistent weak business confidence and investment as well as long-standing structural labour market rigidities continue to constrain South Africas economic growth,"" Moodys said, adding that these factors mean South Africa is entering a period of much lower global growth in an ""economically vulnerable position."" Debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) increased by 10 percentage points from 2014-18 and Moodys expects this to rise by a further 22 percentage points between 2019 and 2023, with the deficit widening in 2020 to around 8.5% of GDP. Fiscal strains from interest payments and support to state-owned enterprises will continue, the agency predicted. The government debt burden is expected to rise from 69% of GDP in 2019 to 91% by the end of 2023.It is up to South Africa""South Africas credit rating has deteriorated because of very low (and currently negative) economic growth, large fiscal deficits and sharply rising public debt, loss-making state-owned entities, and deep contestation of proposed social and economic policy reforms,"" explained Jeff Gable, head of research at South Africas Absa Bank. In a statement Monday, Gable suggested that whether South Africa will return to investment grade or slide further away relies on the country demonstrating ""significant improvement"" in its economic reforms. ""It is hard to argue that South Africa hasnt witnessed a steep deterioration in fundamentals, in part by our own inability to act over the last decade and in part due to the new risks due to the global virus,"" Gable said. ""And so it is the agencies duty to reflect that in their ratings. Similarly it is clear that it is up to South Africa, and not the credit rating agencies, as to which direction that country would like to take going forward.""Bold structural reformsOn Sunday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor Lesetja Kganyago held a media conference call, in which Mboweni said that he and President Cyril Ramaphosa had vowed to move ""more boldly"" on their structural reforms program. Mboweni announced the creation of a unit within the finance ministry called ""Vulindlela"" – which means ""lead the way"" in isiZulu – that ""will become the front soldiers of structural reforms in the South African economy,"" according to a research note Monday from NKC African Economics.President Cyril Ramaphosa during a pre-World Economic Forum breakfast briefing on January 18, 2018 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

(b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Companys U.S. tax return exam.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2022Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2021Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI (1)Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI (1)(in millions, except per share amounts)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to AES and Diluted EPS $ 115$ 0.16$ (148)$ (0.22)Add: Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations attributable to AES 50(36)Pre-tax contribution $ 165$ (184)AdjustmentsUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses $ 41$ 0.06 (2) $ 69$ 0.10 (3) Unrealized foreign currency losses (gains) (19)(0.02) (4) 60.01Disposition/acquisition losses (gains) 90.01(15)(0.02) (5) Impairment losses 1—4750.71 (6) Loss on extinguishment of debt 100.0160.01Net gains from early contract terminations at Angamos ——(110)(0.16) (7) Less: Net income tax benefit(0.01)(0.15) (8) Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS $ 207$ 0.21$ 247$ 0.28(1) NCI is defined as Noncontrolling Interests.

Subsidiary Distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with US GAAP. Subsidiary Distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company. The reconciliation of the difference between the Subsidiary Distributions and Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature. These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies. (2) Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs), plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility. AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES indebtedness. (3) The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.SOURCE AES CORP."
Moody's Rating,https://www.barrons.com/articles/fitch-keeps-ges-credit-rating-at-investment-grade-51566925097,Brazil stripped of investment grade rating as crisis deepens,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil lost its coveted investment-grade rating on Wednesday after Fitch became the second credit agency to downgrade the country’s debt to junk status, citing concerns about an economic and political crisis threatening to topple President Dilma Rousseff.Fitch downgraded Brazil to BB+ with a negative outlook less than 24 hours after the left-leaning Rousseff moved to loosen next year’s budget targets in a bid to safeguard spending for welfare programs. The decision undercut her orthodox finance minister, Joaquim Levy who staked his reputation on an austerity agenda that has now stalled in Congress.Levy blamed the government’s abandonment of targets needed to cut debt for Fitch’s decision.“Obviously the goal of zero (debt reduction) is very bad and resulted in the downgrade,” he told Band News TV late Wednesday.The real currency and dollar-denominated bonds tumbled amid forced selling after the downgrade, which came just three months after Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s rating to junk, further clouding the outlook for an economy reeling from its sharpest downturn in a quarter-century.Investors barred from owning junk bonds could dispose of about $20 billion in Brazilian sovereign and corporate debt after two agencies downgraded Brazil, analysts at JPMorgan Securities estimated in October.It marked a bitter reversal for Latin America’s largest economy, seven years after a commodities-fueled boom helped propel it to investment-grade status, feeding expectation that its economy would escape sharp cycles of boom and bust that has kept millions in poverty.Fitch said a deepening political crisis had restricted the government’s ability to right the economy. Rousseff’s opponents have accused her of breaking budget rules and are trying to impeach her, while key allies are threatening to bolt her coalition amid a widening bribery scandal at state-run oil company Petrobras.With Fitch leaving Brazil’s credit outlook on negative, and Moody’s Investor Services also reviewing its rating, further downgrades to the country’s creditworthiness could follow.“The impeachment proceeding is a setback,” Shelly Shetty, Fitch’s head of Latin American sovereign ratings, told Reuters after the downgrade. “Impeachment delays implementation of fiscal measures.”The Supreme Court on Wednesday was weighing the legality of impeachment proceedings against Rousseff after Congress packed a special committee with the president’s opponents in a secret ballot last week.Lower house Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who started the impeachment proceedings, was one of many lawmakers whose homes and offices were raided on Tuesday in the Petrobras probe, which has thrown Congress into disarray and delayed debate of key economic reforms.“It’s hard to be surprised by the Fitch downgrade. Political uncertainties prevent any clarity about the economic outlook,” Candido Bracher, chief executive of Itau BBA, the investment bank unit of Brazil’s largest private bank, told Reuters.‘SLIGHTLY SIDELINED’Following the downgrade, Levy said losing the investment-grade rating was “serious” and showed the government had not done everything required. He was silent when asked if he would stay on as finance minister.Levy set out to win back investor confidence this year with an unpopular austerity agenda but has faced fierce resistance from congressional allies and ministerial rivals, raising expectations for his resignation.Earlier on Wednesday, Levy said he felt “slightly sidelined” by Rousseff’s decision to water down a crucial fiscal savings target for next year.He downplayed the importance of impeachment.“In truth,” he told Band News, “It’s more important for us to understand this: What does the government want? What will it do, OK?”His comments and the Fitch downgrade added to market pressure from a widely anticipated U.S. interest rate hike on Wednesday, which has drawn investors away from riskier emerging markets like Brazil in recent months.The Brazilian real, fell about 2 percent in Wednesday trading. Dollar-denominated bonds also tumbled sharply, and five-year credit default swaps rose 28 basis points to 482 bps, according to data from Markit.“Local rates and currency will be under pressure in the next couple of days because of forced selling by index funds,” said Bernd Berg, director for emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale.Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s rating to junk in September, and Moody’s Investors Service put the country on review last week for a possible downgrade to that level.Fitch’s downgrade of the sovereign credit rating worsens the outlook for large corporate borrowers already contending with the rising borrowing costs, said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland in London.Downgrades could drive up borrowing costs for large-scale borrowers such as iron ore company Vale SA and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is known. The nation’s largest banks, such as Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA, may also face higher borrowing costs.This year, global bond offerings by Brazilian companies have plummeted 82 percent to about $5.7 billion, according to Credit Suisse Group AG data. Brazil has accounted for less than 9 percent of Latin American global debt offerings this year, down from 32 percent in 2014."
Moody's Rating,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sp-raises-portugal-credit-rating-to-investment-grade-2017-09-15,Ford Loses Investment-Grade Status: What It Means,"Ford Motor Company (F 0.01%) has lost its investment-grade status. Standard & Poors cut Fords credit rating to BB+, one step below investment-grade, on concerns that the shutdown of its North American factories will hurt Fords margins and cash flow for an extended period.Fords return to investment-grade status in 2012, following the 2008-2009 economic crisis, was a hard-won goal for the company. It was rightly celebrated at the time. But with this downgrade, 2 of the 3 major credit-rating agencies now rate Ford below the BBB level -- meaning that the companys credit rating is now, technically speaking, junk.Heres what we know, and what it might mean.What S&P said about Fords credit ratingIn a short note released after the markets closed on Wednesday, S&P said that the coronavirus pandemic added to its existing concerns about Ford.The decision to downgrade Ford Motor Co. investment grade to speculative grade reflects that the companys credit metrics and competitive position became borderline for the investment-grade rating prior to the coronavirus outbreak, and the expected downturn in light-vehicle demand made it unlikely that Ford would maintain the required metrics.S&P said that the current rating has ""negative implications,"" meaning that theres at least a 50% chance that it could lower Fords rating further at some point in the near future. S&Ps analysts are waiting to see how long Fords factories will be shut down, and how severely demand for light vehicles will be impacted once they restart.A quick primer on corporate credit ratingsThere are three major agencies that rate corporate credit: S&P, Moodys Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings. If two out of the three rate a companys credit below the BBB level (or equivalent), the companys debt is considered ""speculative,"" rather than ""investment grade.""The implications are simple: The lower a companys credit rating, the more it will have to pay (in interest) to borrow money.""Junk bond"" is Wall Streets slang term for bonds with a speculative credit rating. Its most often used to refer to debt issued by companies with very low credit ratings (in the Cs, rather than the Bs), but it can apply to anything in the ""speculative"" range.S&Ps move follows cuts to Fords rating by Moodys and FitchS&P isnt the first to downgrade Ford -- in fact, its the third.Fitch Ratings downgraded Ford to BBB-, the very lowest level thats still considered investment-grade, in a note on Tuesday (March 24) that reflected the analysts concerns about what could happen after the pandemic subsides:Fitch currently believes the company has the financial flexibility to manage through an extended shutdown of its facilities, but concerns are increasing that a combination of an extended shutdown followed by weak demand in a global recessionary environment could further pressure the companys credit profile.Like S&P, Fitch warned that it could cut Fords rating further, depending on how things unfold over the next few months.Moodys, meanwhile, cut Fords credit rating to speculative levels last fall. In a note released on September 9, Moodys said that it had become concerned that CEO Jim Hacketts extensive restructuring of the company (what Ford calls a ""redesign"") is likely to cost billions of dollars just as the global new-car market appeared to be softening.Remember, this was in September of 2019:[T]he erosion in Fords performance has occurred during a period in which global automotive conditions have been fairly healthy. Ford now faces the challenge of addressing these operational problems as demand in major markets is softening, and as the auto industry is contending with an unprecedented pace of change relating to vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, ride sharing, and increasingly burdensome emission regulations.One of Moodys concerns at the time was that the economic waters were likely to get choppier before Fords redesign was completed. I think we can say that they were right.What does it mean for Ford investors?I know that this is a disappointment for Fords executives and employees. But for auto investors, Im not sure it matters a whole lot right now. Its not really a surprise to hear at this moment that Ford (and every other automaker outside China) is going to have a tough time until the coronavirus pandemic subsides -- and depending on the condition of the economies in North America and Europe when it does, possibly for quite a while after.This development means that Ford will have to pay more to borrow money, whether via credit lines or debt issues. But right now, that seems like a small drop in a very large bucket: The moves that Ford makes in the coming days and weeks to cut costs and restart its factories will matter much more to investors over the next little while."
Moody's Rating,https://www.autoevolution.com/news/moody-boosts-fords-credit-rating-to-investment-grade-45285.html,Tesla moves closer to ‘Investment Grade’ rating with S&P Global following Q1 showing,"ByTesla moved closer to the S&P Global’s “Investment Grade” rating after reporting a strong first quarter with a solid financial balance sheet, especially in terms of free cash flow, while navigating tough macro conditions in the sector.“S&P Global Ratings today said that Tesla Inc.’s first-quarter results (ended March 31, 2022) indicate solid execution and prospects for robust free cash flow in 2022 amid supply disruptions,” the organization wrote in a bulletin.Tesla’s Q1 2022 Earnings Call took place on Wednesday, where CEO Elon Musk and other executives outlined the automaker’s strongest performance in its short-but-storied history. Tesla posted over $18.7 billion in revenue, beating consensus estimates of $17.8 billion. It also beat EPS estimates of $2.27 by posting a nearly $1 beat at $3.22 per share.Perhaps the most impressive statistic of Tesla’s quarterly breakdown on its Shareholder Deck was its ability to navigate through global supply chain issues and chip shortages, two issues that have plagued many industries with automotive being amongst the hardest hit. Tesla said:“Challenges around supply chain have remained persistent, and our team has been navigating through them for over a year. In addition to chip shortages, recent COVID-19 outbreaks have been weighing on our supply chain and factory operations. Furthermore, prices of some raw materials have increased multiple-fold in recent months. The inflationary impact on our cost structure has contributed to adjustments in our product pricing, despite a continued focus on reducing our manufacturing costs where possible.”Despite the challenges, Tesla’s automotive division performed well above expectations by delivering 310,048 vehicles in Q1, a new company record. Its largest contributors to revenue generation were growth in vehicle deliveries, increased average selling price, and growth in other parts of Tesla’s business.Its performance in Q1 has the S&P nearly ready to promote the company’s stock to an “Investment Grade” rating. In October, the organization upgraded Tesla to a BB+ rating, but as the industry continues to expand, the company holds a competitive advantage. Tesla will have to improve one level, from BB+ to BBB, to be considered “Investment Grade,” by the S&P Global’s standards.“At this stage, Tesla appears to be in a very strong position relative to its competitors to raise its cell capacity and complete the ramp up of its production to meet demand,” the S&P Global Ratings wrote. “Specifically, we believe the electric vehicle (EV) maker is on track to increase its annual vehicle deliveries toward our forecast of roughly 1.5 million over the next 12 months, which follows its delivery of 936,000 vehicles in 2021 and over 310,000 in the first quarter of 2022. While competition is increasing with numerous launches of new EV models, we recently increased our EV penetration to reach 15%-25% of the global fleet by 2025, which should support Tesla’s ability to increase sales of its vehicles.”I’d love to hear from you!

The city has about $2 billion of debt outstanding.The city suffered pandemic hits on multiple fronts from the loss of income taxes due to non-residents working remotely and plummeting wagering taxes from shuttered casinos.“Despite those pressures, Detroit posted its sixth consecutive operating surplus in fiscal 2021 and is on pace for another strong year in fiscal 2022,” Moody’s analysts David Levett and Robert Weber said in the report. “The upgrade to Ba2 reflects the citys healthy financial position supported by strong management that has successfully navigated challenges, such as weak property tax wealth, volatile revenue structure and limited revenue-raising flexibility.”Remote work will remain a strain but wagering taxes received a boost last year from newly implemented collections on internet gaming, according to a revenue estimating conference’s latest report. While the pandemic hit revenues hard, federal aid and early action to cut spending cushioned the pain and paved the way for fund balances.Detroit won an upgrade from Moodys. Bloomberg NewsSignificant bonded and pension debt weigh on the rating and while fixed costs are moderate, they are on the rise with pension contributions set to resume in fiscal 2024. The city is “well-poised” for further strengthening but risks loom and if revenues don’t keep up, cuts will be needed to maintain fiscal momentum, Moody’s warned.“The positive outlook reflects the likelihood that the rating will move upward if financial operations and reserves continue to strengthen, positioning the city well to address growing pension costs and future revenue downturns,” Moody’s said.“Moody’s upgrade is an acknowledgement of the hard work done to restore the city from bankruptcy,"" Jay Rising, the citys chief financial officer, said in a statement. ""We know we have more work ahead of us and we are confident we will overcome the challenges to the city’s credit posed by risks with future pension funding.""Mayor Mike Duggan on Monday unveiled a proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 that funnels $31 million from a $130 million fund balance that would bring the reserve to $138 million and another $30 million would go to boost a scheduled $60 million contribution to the special Retiree Protection Fund (RPF) set up to help cover future pension contributions.Duggan said reserve deposits planned over the next three years — $15 million in 2024 and $5 million in 2025 — would bring the account to 12% of budget. The goal is to eventually reach 15% in hopes that will help lift the city from junk territory, Duggan said.If the deposits are approved, it would bring the RFP balance to $460 million, providing a cushion to help meet annual contributions that are expected to range from $130 million to $200 million in the coming decades.That’s a good thing, but “the scale of the citys pension contribution challenges will be heavily influenced by the investment returns of its pension systems and length of amortization, which was recently shortened in one plan to 20 years from 30 years and part of our baseline assumption,” Moody’s said.Duggan told council members Monday he intends to return to the federal bankruptcy court to challenge the police and firefighters fund’s decision to amortize legacy pension obligation over 20 years as stakeholders agreed to the 30-year term during bankruptcy negotiations. Duggan may also seek state legislation giving the city a greater say on the fund’s decisions.The city’s 2014 plan of adjustment required just a $20 million contribution from the general fund to pension plans through 2019 and no contributions from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2023.When contributions resume in fiscal 2024, the city owes an estimated $131 million based on the police and fire fund change to pay down legacy obligations over a 20-year period instead of 30 years and the general employee fund remaining at 30 years.If the city prevails in its efforts to amortize both legacy funds over 30 years, the contribution drops to $117 million. If the other fund moves to a 20-year term, the payment rises to $141 million.“If assumptions hold, the trust would be available to smooth payments for 15 years, limiting annual growth in payments to about $5 million annually. However, Detroit’s contribution requirements will be heavily influenced by the investment returns of its two pension systems,” Moody’s said.With city contributions on hold, payments into the funds have mostly been limited to funds coming from the other sources, such the Great Lakes Water Authority and from the so-called ""Grand Bargain"" struck as part of the bankruptcy, which provided more than $800 million from private foundations and the state to stave off deeper pension benefits.That’s left the unfunded liabilities to grow, Moody’s said. The citys reported net pension liability totaled $1.8 billion at the close of fiscal 2021.The Police and Fire Retirement System defends its move, saying it must act in the best interest of retirees with its investment committee charged with that task as part of the bankruptcy exit plan.“The PFRS has a fiduciary obligation is to ensure that benefits are paid to retired police, firefighters and their beneficiaries,” PFRS Chairman Ron Thomas said. “Trustees have heard from our actuarial and other financial advisors that have run numerous what-if scenarios based on multiple funding models …the 20-year model is clearly in the best interest of retirees.”The system praised Duggan’s budget proposal to funnel more to the RPF. “We appreciate the mayor and city administration’s stewardship of the city and ability to manage its budget amid the pandemic,” Thomas said. The funds pay out $350 million annually.Other strains weigh on the city’s finances. Detroit’s trajectory is especially susceptible to an economic downtown as its heavily tied to the domestic auto industry and resident incomes are very low, Moody’s said.Bright spots on the development front include a series of new projects with General Motors, Ford, and a number of auto suppliers having announced major investments expected to create thousands of jobs, Moody’s said.“Detroit is also a logistics hub, a position that will be bolstered by a second international crossing that is being constructed, the Gordie Howe International Bridge,” Moody’s said. Huntington Bank, which recently absorbed Chemical Bank and TCF bank, is making Detroit its commercial banking headquarters with a 20-story building under construction.Moody’s anticipates the city’s bonded debt to grow with another $75 million of a $250 million voter-approved general obligation authorization to remove blight still on the books following a $175 million issue last year and another $71 million in voter-approved authority for capital. Ahead of last year’s sale, S&P Global Ratings returned the outlook on its BB-minus rating to stable from negative.The city must present balanced budgets that look ahead four years to the Detroit Financial Review Commission annually to win a waiver from direct state oversight. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of just under 640,000, making it one of the 30 largest cities in the U.S. and the largest in Michigan, Moodys said."

Moody's Rating,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/26/ford-loses-investment-grade-status-what-it-means.aspx,"EQT anticipates return to investment grade, more LNG options for certified gas","Appalachian shale gas producer EQT Corp. expects its corporate credit rating will return to investment grade in the first half of 2022, executives said.""Investment-grade status unlocks multiple benefits such as improved cost and access to capital as well as the ability to sign long-term domestic and international sales contracts,"" EQT President and CEO Toby Rice told analysts on a Feb. 10 conference call to discuss fourth-quarter 2021 earnings results.CFO David Khani said EQT will likely sign its own LNG supply contracts later this year, with prices pegged to higher-priced European or Asian indexes rather than the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub.""Were having lots of conversations right now with LNG players across the whole chain,"" Khani said.Khani said a bump to investment grade would immediately return $400 million in cash used to back letters of credit and would reduce EQTs bond interest rates.Other viewsCredit research firm CreditSights said EQT may be too optimistic about a return to investment grade in the near future. ""Well-below-strip hedges put in place to de-risk the Alta Resources LLC acquisition limit upside to the recent natural gas price rally,"" senior analyst Charles Johnston told clients after the call. EQT closed on the purchase of Altas Northeast Marcellus Shale assets in July 2021.""EQT has roughly 63% of 2022 estimated gas production hedged, resulting in our year-end 2022 projections of [net leverage] 1.5x and 56% funds from operations/debt,"" Johnston said. ""In order to return to [investment grade], S&P is looking for sustained FFO/debt greater than 60%.""EQTs efforts to get the bulk of its 5.5 Bcfe per day of production certified as responsibly sourced gas, or RSG, are paying off, executives said. EQT is realizing a 5 cent/Mcf premium for gas certified by a third party as having lower methane emissions. That announcement marks one of the first times a shale gas company has pegged the value of the RSG tag.Rice said the work on environmental, social and governance issues is adding value to the company. ""We have signed 10 deals encompassing roughly 1.2 Tcfe in total for around $60 million in premiums to date,"" Rice said. ""We expect the value of RSG will improve further as the market develops and as the cost of carbon increases. Lastly, we are attracting interest from several LNG parties across the whole value chain to gain exposure to international prices.""Investors seemed to agree. Although EQTs adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share fell short of analyst expectations, they traded shares up about 1% to close at $21.67 on heavier than normal volume. The consensus of analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence was for 53 cents per share.Increase in free cash flowFree cash flow generation is becoming a dominant metric for shale oil and gas producers, with investors focused on dividends and share buybacks. EQT reported $422 million in free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2021, nearly four times the $109 million it saw in the same period in 2020. The company said it should report roughly $1.6 billion in free cash in 2022, a 68% increase over 2021, and more than $10 billion in free cash through 2026. For now, EQT will stick to its previously announced $1 billion share buyback and annual dividend of 50 cents per share.""The company announced a 2022 plan consisting of maintenance capex 5%/3% above our/street forecasts and production ~2% below our/street forecasts,"" Truist Securities Inc. analyst Neal Dingmann told clients before the call. ""As wed expect to see with nearly all of our companies, service cost inflation appears to be the key driver behind the higher capex guidance.""EQTs adjusted fourth-quarter 2021 income of $156 million reversed $5 million in adjusted losses in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a GAAP basis, EQT reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.8 billion, or $4.69 per share, on the strength of a $1 billion gain on derivatives not designated as hedges. In the same period in 2020, EQT reported $63.6 million in profits.EQT produced 527 Bcfe in the quarter, almost all-natural gas, a 31% increase over the final quarter of 2020. The bulk of the new volumes came from Appalachian assets that the company purchased from Chevron Corp. and from its purchase of Alta Resources.EQT reported realizing $2.68/Mcfe after hedging for its fourth-quarter production, a 17% increase over the year-ago quarter."
Moody's Rating,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-moves-closer-to-investment-grade-rating-with-sp-global-following-q1-showing/,Bitcoin Is The Only Investment-Grade Digital Asset,"Every four years or so, bitcoin’s seemingly cyclical nature rears its head and the rise of another bull market begins. There are headlines across mainstream media outlets boasting massive price action, and droves of people start coming out of the woodwork to claim that they have been long on bitcoin for years! However, there is also another, more nefarious cyclical event that inevitably surfaces as well. The seemingly irresistible allure of alternative cryptocurrencies, tugging at the minds and wallets of individuals who are looking to recapture what bitcoin has achieved.Those who think they have missed out on bitcoin begin looking to compensate by finding the next big thing, because they are plagued with the mindset that they somehow have “missed out” on bitcoin. There’s no shortage of these dubious crypto assets that claim to be able to unseat bitcoin. They might declare to have faster transactions, cheaper fees or that they are capable of more complex applications. There are literally thousands of these coins, and they have all failed to dethrone the king for 12 years running.The truth is that none of them are even close. In actuality, when you look deeper than surface level, they are illiquid, insecure, centralized copycats perpetuated by bloated marketing budgets, seeking out dummies with deep pockets. They chase the wrong metrics, and are built with flawed incentive structures. Do not fall for the siren’s song. The reality is there is only one “investment-grade” digital asset — Bitcoin.“100 out of 100 of the last conversations I’ve had with investors seriously looking to allocate, let’s say over 50 million dollars, 100% of those conversations have been about Bitcoin and 0% of them have been about any other crypto asset.” Robert Gutmann, CEO of NYDIGCrypto Copy Cats Will Continue To Fall ShortSilicon Valley startups go to sleep at night, and dream about building something that captures the massive returns that bitcoin has offered. Bitcoin has gone from being an idea on a white paper worth $0 to having a $700 billion market cap in just 12 years’ time. All with no funding. No CEO. No marketing team. Just the correct set of economic incentives, embodied in a robust protocol that continues to grow and adapt against all odds. What Silicon Valley’s tech crowd is failing to realize is that this is not solely a competition for who has the best technology or marketing strategy. Bitcoin is truly the first creation of digital scarcity, and was built in such a way that once its first version was released, it would never change.“When tech workers see Bitcoin, they want to fiddle with different parameters: block size, monetary policy, it’s core capability/utility, etc. This is exactly the right mindset when building applications, but the wrong mindset when it comes to building the base layer of the financial system.” Dan Held, “Why Silicon Valley Doesn’t Get Bitcoin”The tech contingent in Silicon Valley can continue to launch VC-funded cryptocurrency projects by the thousands. When they get their hands on these cryptocurrency projects, their first instinct is to tinker. They want to tweak and prod at existing structures and rules, or as the more commonly-used Mark Zuckerberg moniker states “move fast and break things.”This is exactly the opposite of what you would want to do with the software underpinning a $700 billion financial network. Their efforts fail to realize that it is precisely these boring, slow and unchangeable characteristics of Bitcoin that make it so great. At its core, a base layer protocol that aims to be the foundation upon which an entire financial system is built should be exactly that. Rigid, slow-moving, precise and unchangeable.Blockchain Buzzwords And Decentralization TheaterCrypto projects everywhere are trying to woo investors with marketing efforts, business partnerships and buzzwords like “blockchain technology.” Their marketing budgets may be large, but their words are hollow.Many crypto projects love to plaster the term “decentralized” all over their websites and marketing materials, as if it gives their coin an air of legitimacy. Here’s the bad news: If your cryptocurrency has a website, a pitch deck, a marketing budget, an HR department and a CEO that can ultimately be called before Congress… well then, it’s not quite decentralized is it?True DecentralizationBitcoin’s code base is maintained by a widely-dispersed set of developers all over the world, and its network is made up of tens of thousands of individuals freely choosing to run its open-source software. With Bitcoin, there is no marketing budget. In fact, there’s no marketing department at all. There is no leader, no CEO and no HR department. Bitcoin does not have employees on a payroll. Rather, Bitcoin works by aligning human action through a series of elegantly-balanced economic incentives.""It’s decentralized. No company controls it. No government regulates it. It runs on thousands and thousands of decentralized nodes and the obvious thing it is, is an investment-grade safe haven treasury reserve asset."" Michael Saylor, Founder and CEO of MicroStrategyBuyers are incentivized to hold, miners are incentivized to be honest actors, developers are incentivized to commit code, and network participants are incentivized to enforce the consensus rules of the network.Bitcoin even has its brand marketing taken care of. There are thousands of evangelists, writers, podcasters and educational content creators alike who all feel compelled enough to take up the task best suited to them. Out of their own free will, they work to propel the network forward, and push for the mainstream adoption of this nascent digital asset because they believe in the protocol rules and monetary policy enabling a non-sovereign sound money to emerge on the free market. This is what true decentralization looks like.More Than Just TechnologyYes, at its core, Bitcoin is just code. It is a software program, widely dispersed and run on individuals’ computers. But do not let that confuse you into thinking this is solely about technology. Bitcoin’s success is rooted in monetary and social revolution as well. It is the antithesis of the debt-based monetary system we have today. Its network effects have propelled it outside of reach from any competitors for a myriad of reasons. Chief among those is its ability to incentivize humans to carry out the protocol rules via social consensus.“The social layer and its rules are the heart of bitcoin. But the protocol layer makes them enforceable for the first time, while simultaneously making the social contract more credible to outsiders.” Hasu, “Unpacking Bitcoin’s Social Contract”Image from Hasu’s article, “Unpacking Bitcoin’s Social Contract”Entrenchment Is GrowingRegulatory Entrenchment: Entrenchment by both investors and regulators has gained significant momentum over the last several years. On the regulation front, we have seen the following individuals placed in prominent positions within the new administration:Gary Gensler, U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission Chief : Taught cryptocurrency course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Taught cryptocurrency course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chris Brummer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair (pending confirmation) : Authored a book titled “Cryptoassets: Legal, Regulatory, and Monetary Perspectives”: Authored a book titled “Cryptoassets: Legal, Regulatory, and Monetary Perspectives” Brian Brooks, Acting Comptroller of the Currency: Former chief legal officer at Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S.Institutional Entrenchment: Prolific investors like Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and the like have removed career risk for interested money managers. We have also seen an increase of adoption from hedge funds, financial institutions and publicly-traded companies like MicroStrategy and Square, which chose to allocate treasury reserves in bitcoin.None of these significant players listed above are here to pump altcoins, or dubious VC-backed cryptocurrency projects. They are all here for Bitcoin and Bitcoin only. The main reasons for that are clear and obvious. Bitcoin is king when it comes to three core tenets of an investable asset — liquidity, security and the credibility of its monetary policy.Bitcoin has grown and flourished for 12 years and counting. It has withstood network attacks, gained adoption and its heart has kept beating, cranking out a new block of transactions every 10 minutes.However, chief among all characteristics that make bitcoin the only investment-grade digital asset is the credibility of its hard-capped supply, rooted in its protocol rules since inception.

(b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; (g) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (h) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Companys internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring activities, which affect results in a given period or periods.
