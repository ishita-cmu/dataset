Shipping components from China to the United States takes Revlon eight to 12 weeks and costs four times 2019 prices, it said.Revlon is the first major consumer-facing business to file for bankruptcy protection in what has been a yearslong pause of distress in the retail sector. More than three dozen retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2020, marking an 11-year high, which experts say was an extensive and Covid pandemic-driven pull-forward of restructuring activity.Through May 31, S&P Global Market Intelligence tracked 143 bankruptcies, across all industries, so far this year, which is the slowest pace since at least 2010. S&P only tracked three retail bankruptcy filings over the same period, the lowest count in at least 12 years, it said.Now, however, as inflation rages, interest rates rise and consumers begin to pull back spending on discretionary items, experts predict more retail companies will be pressured to restructure. Particularly as many of these businesses grapple with ongoing supply chain challenges that have left them with the wrong inventories.The nail polish and lipstick maker, which is controlled by billionaire Ron Perelmans MacAndrews & Forbes, listed assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion, according to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.Revlon had long-term debt of $3.31 billion as of March 31, a securities filing shows. The companys market cap was nearly $123 million as of the close of trading Wednesday. Trading of Revlon shares was halted in Thursdays premarket session.In late 2020, as stuck-at-home consumers dramatically curtailed their spending on beauty items, Revlon narrowly avoided bankruptcy when enough bondholders took part in its debt restructuring program. The company had warned in early November of that year that it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 protection.Its sales of about $1.9 billion in 2020 were down 21% from 2019 levels. Though the business rebounded in 2021, Revlons revenue is still below pre-pandemic levels.Start-ups including Glossier, Kylie Jenners Kylie Cosmetics and Rihannas Fenty Beauty have also challenged Revlon as it vies for younger consumers dollars.Perelmans MacAndrews & Forbes acquired Revlon in a hostile takeover for about $1.8 billion in 1985. It went public 11 years later.The business grew over the years through acquisitions, including of Cotys Cutex business and Elizabeth Arden. In addition to its namesake makeup banner, its portfolio also includes Almay, American Crew and Britney Spears Fragrances.Revlon could use its time in bankruptcy proceedings to prune its portfolio, given it owns numerous brands, some of which are performing better than others, said David Silverman, a retail senior director at Fitch Ratings.""If executed effectively, Revlon could emerge from bankruptcy with a cleaner balance sheet and a better operating profile, improving longer term business prospects,"" Silverman said.PJT Partners is acting as financial advisor to Revlon, and Alvarez & Marsal is acting as restructuring advisor."

The company is the first of those post-SPAC EV makers to say that it will declare bankruptcy.McIntyre has served as interim chief executive since February, when founder and Chairman Jason Luo and then-CEO Jim Taylor left the struggling start-up after an internal investigation found that the companys past financial statements were unreliable.ELMS said in a statement that those executive departures, and a related investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, had made it ""extremely challenging"" to secure additional funding."

Like many retailers, Paper Sources sales fell last year due to Covid pandemic shutdowns, capacity restrictions, and a wave of canceled weddings and events hurt sales of invitations.Paper Source had purchased 30 new stores from its competitor Papyrus just weeks before the pandemic hit in March 2020.At the time of its bankruptcy filing, Paper Source had 1,700 employees, 158 stores, and $100 million in debt and leases that cost $36 million annually, according to NBC News."

According to the bankruptcy filing, the company is claiming assets of USD 1.07 million (EUR 1.04 million), and liabilities of over USD 1.78 million (EUR 1.73 million).Tropical Aquaculture was purchased in February 2020 by São Paulo, Brazil-based GeneSeas. Prior to its bankruptcy filing, the company listed itself as being involved in seafood sales, distribution, and marketing and was of the first companies in the U.S. to import fresh, premium tilapia.According to the bankruptcy documents, Tropical Aquaculture earned gross revenues of just over USD 36 million (EUR 35.1 million) in 2020. Then, in 2021, that number fell to USD 21.8 million (EUR 21.2 million), and so far in 2022, it has only earned USD 8.3 million (EUR 8.1 million).In its bankruptcy filings, Tropical Aquaculture indicated it has only USD 3,553 (EUR 3,468) in cash or cash equivalents on hand.

An additional $500,000 would come from another insurance policy from Travelers Insurance Co.The insurers are to pay the entirety of their tab upon closing of the settlement, while UnitedLex and CVC would pay in installments, beginning with $2 million up front. They’d then pay an additional $3 million a year later and a final installment of $3.3 million a year after that. The installments would be secured by a letter of credit.The settlement ends the legal wrangling that began with trustee Lynn Tavenner suing UnitedLex in 2020, seeking $128 million in damages, claiming the company wrongfully benefited from LeClairRyan’s demise through their failed ULX Partners joint venture.ULX Partners was formed by UnitedLex and LeClairRyan in 2019, just prior to the law firm’s demise that same year. ULX was a back-office job outsourcing effort billed at the time as an innovative cost-cutting approach, but is now seen as having had a hand in LeClairRyan’s undoing. Tavenner had alleged that ULX was a conspiracy to siphon millions out of the 30-year-old law firm as it was teetering toward collapse.The settlement was an eleventh-hour agreement reached by both sides in April after a testy mediation and just weeks before the case was to go to trial. It also allows all involved to walk away without admitting fault or liability and calls for the defendants to withdraw any creditor claims it has against the estate.The settlement, which was crafted by mediator Frank Santoro, a seasoned bankruptcy judge from Hampton Roads, also includes $3.2 million for law firm Quinn Emanuel, the trustee’s counsel, for a so-called “improvident payment.”Details regarding the need for the improvident payment are minimal in court records from the case, much of which have been redacted in recent weeks at the request of the defendants.The payment was described at a hearing in April as an “equalizer,” due to the case — and particularly the dispute with UnitedLex — becoming more involved and time-consuming than expected.The payment to the law firm was disputed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office, which argued it would provide Quinn Emanuel with an “improper windfall,” in light of a 35 percent contingency fee that was also built into the agreement for the law firm.Huennekens disagreed, stating in his June 28 opinion that, “The court has found that the improvident payment is specifically warranted under the unique — and hopefully unrepeatable — facts and circumstances of this bankruptcy case and these adversary proceedings.”Huennekens did rule that the 35 percent contingency should be calculated after subtracting the improvident payment and other certain expenses from the total settlement.The opinion includes numerous redacted passages, a result of the defendants successfully requesting the sealing of certain documents and details in the case.The ULX settlement is the latest multimillion-dollar settlement for the LeClairRyan estate. The firm’s namesake and longtime CEO Gary LeClair had been a defendant in the same UnitedLex case but was released from the matter after reaching a $10 million settlement with the estate in late 2021. Other former insiders from the law firm were also part of the settlement, which was funded by insurance proceeds.The overall LeClairRyan bankruptcy case remains ongoing."

Lampert remained chairman of the board.﻿﻿ The firm began to restructure after it failed to pay back $134 million that was due on Oct. 15.﻿﻿Key Takeaways Sears Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15, 2018, at which time it had 700 stores across the U.S., $6.9 billion in assets and $11.3 billion in liabilities. ﻿ ﻿﻿ Eddie Lampert, chairman of Kmart, purchased Sears for $11 billion in 2004, changing the name of the company to Sears Holdings. ﻿ ﻿﻿ The companys biggest competitors to date have been Walmart and Amazon. Other rivals include Macys, JC Penney, Home Depot, Lowes, and Best Buy.Sears Holdings spun off and sold many of its business units and brand names.The companys stock IPO was issued in 1906 but was delisted from the Nasdaq in Oct. 2018. ﻿ ﻿Where Is Sears Today?A bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the companys assets for $5.2 billion to Lampert in a bankruptcy auction. About 425 stores remained open as of April 2019, with nearly 45,000 jobs intact. When its Chapter 11 filing was announced, Sears had nearly 700 stores open in the U.S., compared to 3,500 Sears and Kmart when they merged in 2005.﻿﻿The company stopped selling Whirlpool appliances in 2017, which it carried since 1916. An internal company memo reportedly cited pricing disputes.﻿﻿ In August 2018, Lampert offered to buy the Kenmore appliance brand for $400 million in cash through his hedge fund ESL Investments after the company failed to find other takers.﻿﻿ ESL also offered to buy Sears Home Improvement business for $80 million in cash.﻿﻿""Over the last several years, we have worked hard to transform our business and unlock the value of our assets,"" Lampert said in the statement announcing the bankruptcy petition. ""While we have made progress, the plan has yet to deliver the results we have desired, and addressing the Companys immediate liquidity needs has impacted our efforts to become a profitable and more competitive retailer. The Chapter 11 process will give Holdings the flexibility to strengthen its balance sheet, enabling the Company to accelerate its strategic transformation, continue right-sizing its operating model, and return to profitability.""﻿﻿In Sept. 2018, SHLD share prices fell below a dollar, and it further slid to trading close to 50 cents on Oct. 10, 2018.﻿﻿Sears Holdings filed a lawsuit against Lampert and ESL Investments, saying it was stripped of its most valuable assets, forcing it into bankruptcy. The lawsuit said the assets—including Orchard Supply Hardware Stores, Sears Canada, and Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores among others—were valued at about $2 billion. ESL responded, saying the allegations in the lawsuit are without merit.﻿﻿A Tale of Retail HubrisIt started by selling a single product category. But when it became clear that a sleepy, overpriced retail sector would crumble before it, there was nothing to stop the company from selling anything and everything. You could order from the comfort of your own home. You could pay a fair price. It would ship the goods right to you. Sales exploded, and if youd picked up a big enough chunk of stock when the company went public, youd never have to work again.That description once applied to Sears, Roebuck, and Co., but now it better describes the company thats blamed for—or credited with—its looming demise, Amazon. Having played the role of an upstart retail juggernaut in the 1890s, Sears now finds itself in the same position as the rural general stores it used to drive out of business en masse.On the other hand, Sears demise is not all Amazons fault, nor is it a simple circle-of-life parable. Sears made its share of mistakes.In its 2016 annual report, the company listed Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Kohls (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Macys (M), Home Depot (HD), Lowes (LOW), Best Buy (BBY), and Amazon as its main competitors. As of Oct. 2018, Sears lost 96% of its value since it began trading under its current ticker in May 2003. J.C. Penney has done even worse, but Lowes, Best Buy, and Home Depot have all seen their share prices at least double.Amazon shares, on the other hand, are up nearly 33-fold. Even for a brick-and-mortar retailer in the digital era, Sears is struggling.Sears Rise: The First 90 YearsIn the mid-1880s, Richard Sears worked as a station agent for the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in North Redwood, Minnesota. He would sell lumber and coal on the side, giving him experience that came in handy when, in 1886, a local jeweler rejected a shipment of gold-filled watches from Chicago. Sears bought them himself, sold them at a profit, and ordered more. He founded the R.W. Sears Watch Company in Minneapolis, then moved to Chicago in 1887 and partnered with Alvah C. Roebuck, a watchmaker from Indiana. Both were in their twenties.They launched a catalog of watches and jewelry the following year and incorporated Sears, Roebuck, and Co. in 1893. Two years later, a Chicago clothing manufacturer, Julius Rosenwald, bought into the company. By that time, the mail-order operation branched out from watches. Sales reached $750,000, and Sears iconic catalog ballooned to 532 pages. Farmers, fed up with understocked and overpriced general stores, flocked to Sears.The company sold stock in 1906 in the first initial public offering (IPO) for an American retail firm—the first to be handled by Goldman Sachs. It opened a 40-acre logistics center in Chicago that very same year. Henry Ford eventually made a pilgrimage to this ""seventh wonder of the business world"" to learn about the companys storied efficiency.Sears Holdings was delisted from the Nasdaq in Oct. 2018 and began trading over-the-counter.﻿﻿Ford would throw a wrench in Sears business model, as cars made chain stores more appealing and mail-order catalogs less crucial for rural customers. Sears adapted, opening retail stores in the 1920s that outsold the catalog by 1931. Revenues totaled $180 million that year—around $2.8 billion in todays dollars. The company began to introduce its own brands in the 1920s, including Craftsman, DieHard, and Kenmore. It began selling insurance through its Allstate subsidiary in 1931.﻿﻿Sears Downfall: The Past 50 YearsIn 1969, Sears, the largest retailer in the world, began construction on the worlds tallest skyscraper. The Sears Towers completion four years later may not mark the companys peak, but its retail dominance began to fade around that time. In the 1980s, it adopted a ""socks and stocks"" strategy, expanding into financial services beyond its existing insurance business. In 1981, the company purchased Dean Witter Reynolds Organization Inc., a stockbroker, and Coldwell, Banker & Co., a real estate broker. It launched Discover Card through Dean Witter in 1985.﻿﻿In 1984, together with IBM (IBM) and (for a time) CBS, the company created what would become Prodigy, a pre-web online portal. Built on a private network, it was distinct from the Internet but presaged it in many ways, offering email, games, news, weather, sports, and shopping.﻿﻿In 1992, when Sears revenues reached $59 billion, the company announced plans to simplify its structure. It took parts of Dean Witter and Allstate public, then distributed the remaining shares to investors. Having sunk over $1 billion into the Prodigy project between them, Sears and IBM received less than $200 million from the sale in 1996. Sears also sold Coldwell Banker, along with other financial services subsidiaries.﻿﻿Sears discontinued its famous catalog in 1993.﻿﻿According to the company archives, it ""returned to its retailing roots"" by 1999.﻿﻿ In fact, it retained a significant consumer credit division, with U.S. borrowers accounting for 61% of the companys $2.5 billion in operating income in 2002. Investors began to worry that the early-2000s recession made credit card issuance too risky, and Sears sold the business to Citigroup (C) in 2003.﻿﻿At the turn of the century, Sears turned to the web in earnest. A July 2000 press release boasted that sears.com sold home electronics, computers, office equipment, appliances, cookware, baby products, and school uniforms.﻿﻿ Amazon, meanwhile, only just began branching out from books to offer software, video games, and home improvement products in Nov. 1999.At that time, Sears problem was not so much Amazon as it was Walmart, which became the nations largest retailer in the 1990s.Sears, Meet KmartKmart announced it would buy Sears for $11 billion in Nov. 2004. The combined companies—to be headquartered in Chicago and called Sears Holdings—would operate around 3,500 locations. Analysts expressed excitement at combining the fading giants mainstays, cross-selling brands such as Sears Craftsman and Kmarts Martha Stewart Everyday. Management promised to save $500 million a year by 2007, partly through job cuts and store closings.﻿﻿﻿The deals mastermind was Kmart chairman Edward Lampert, a Goldman Sachs (GS) alumnus and one-time roommate of former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at Yale. Lampert left Goldman to start a hedge fund in 1988 at the age of 25 and bought up Kmarts debt when the retailer declared bankruptcy in 2002. He gained a 53% stake in the company for less than $1 billion. A week after the merger with Sears was announced, Bloomberg reported that Kmarts market capitalization was $8.6 billion.﻿﻿﻿﻿Lampert Takes the ReinsAs chairman of the combined company—he took on the CEO role as well in 2013—Lampert initially attracted breathless praise from the media. A 2004 Bloomberg Businessweek cover story called him ""the next Warren Buffett. "" Just as Buffett turned a failing textile company into a vehicle for superhuman returns, Lampert would use Kmart as a cash cow for savvy acquisitions. His hedge funds average annual return of 29% from its inception to 2003 boded well.A little over 13 years later, such comparisons seem ridiculous. Sears Holdings sales rose in 2006, its first full year as a combined company, but then fell in each of the following nine years. For a while, Sears stock rose anyway, but the financial crisis wiped 85% off its value between its April 2007 high and its November 2008 low. The recovery was tepid and short-lived. Shares peaked again that April at less than two-thirds their pre-crisis high. They have not recovered since.Kmart was Lamperts first majority stake, and he proved to be a better speculator than a manager. A 2013 Bloomberg article excoriates his Ayn Rand-inspired approach: In 2008, he split the company into 30 divisions—which swelled to 40 a year later—each of which reported profits separately and had to compete with the others for resources. Lampert was both strict with money and distant, seldom leaving his home in South Florida.Divisions found themselves acting like separate companies, even drawing up contracts with each other. Compensation costs rose as each division hired its own senior management. These executives, in turn, had to form their own boards, and their pay was determined according to an in-house profit metric that led to cannibalization as some divisions cut jobs, forcing others to step in. The appliances unit found itself being gouged by the Kenmore unit, so it bought wares from LG, a South Korean conglomerate, instead.The combined companys profits peaked at $1.5 billion in 2006, then dwindled to nearly nothing by 2010. The company lost $10.4 billion from 2011 to 2016. In 2014, its total debt surpassed its market cap.While Lampert experimented with new management techniques, Amazon built a retail empire. Its total sales were a mere 17% of Sears in 2005, the first full year after the Kmart merger. But whereas Sears revenues fell by 14% over the following five years, Amazons nearly quadrupled. In 2011 the tech giant surpassed Sears, then lapped it in 2013. In 2016 it made $136 billion in sales to Sears $22 billion.When Kmarts acquisition of Sears was announced in 2004, Lampert commented, ""I dont think any retailer should aspire to have its real estate be worth more than its operating business.""Sears Spins off Assets, Cuts StaffAs Sears prospects fade, however, investors began eyeing its real estate. Sears spun off around 200 properties into a real estate investment trust (REIT) that began trading as Seritage Growth Properties (SRG) in July 2015.﻿﻿ Other assets have been spun off as well, including Lands End and Sears Canada. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) agreed to buy Craftsman in Jan. 2017.﻿﻿Sears cut the hours, pay, and headcount of retail staff to save cash, causing stores and customer experience to deteriorate. ""We have a 17-year-old running the office and cash office,"" one employee wrote to Business Insider in Aug. 2016. ""He has no experience in either, but he is a warm body to fill the job. The end is coming soon, get out while you can.""﻿﻿An affiliate of Lamperts hedge fund agreed to loan Sears up to $500 million in Jan. 2017, bringing the total amount Lampert has plowed back into the business since Sept. 2014 to around $1 billion.﻿﻿In another attempt to save its business, Sears announced a deal with Amazon (AMZN) on May 9, 2018, in which the retail chain would use Sears Auto Centers to install car tires ordered on Amazon. Sears shares jumped almost 20% on the news. This was not the first time Sears partnered with Amazon—the company landed deals to sell appliances and car batteries on Amazon in 2017.﻿﻿In the second quarter of 2018, Sears posted overall revenue down 25%, but same-store sales decline slowed. The retailer posted a loss of $508 million for the quarter, bringing its total loss since 2010, its last profitable year, to over $11 billion.﻿﻿Lampert attempted to buy Sears assets out of bankruptcy for $4.4 billion through his investment company, ESL Investments.﻿﻿The Bottom LineIt would be easy to read this story as a triumph of ecommerce, or to reflect on the irony that Sears was a first-mover when it came to online shopping, with its proto-Internet joint venture Prodigy. But even recently, Sears has been ahead of the curve in that area. According to Bloomberg, Lampert ""showered"" the online division with resources while the rest fought over a shrinking pie.﻿﻿Nor did competition with Amazon alone precipitate Sears decline. When sales and profits began to fade, in the mid-2000s, other big-box retailers—particularly Walmart—were thriving. In 2011, the year Sears lost over $3.1 billion, Walmart made $16.4 billion.﻿﻿Perhaps the might-have-been next Warren Buffett should have listened to the original, who told University of Kansas students in 2005, ""Eddie is a very smart guy, but putting Kmart and Sears together is a tough hand. Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?""﻿﻿"

Like McClatchy, Gannett thrived in the last century as a family-run enterprise.Gannett reached its current size in November when it merged with GateHouse Media. Before the deal went through, Fortress — which is owned by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate founded by Masayoshi Son — controlled New Media Investment Group, the parent of GateHouse. Although GateHouse was the larger of the two companies, the supersize version of the two took the Gannett name.Another major news publisher, MediaNewsGroup, is owned by Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund. Newspapers under Alden control, including The Denver Post and The San Jose Mercury News, have laid off significant numbers of employees. In 2018, the Post newsroom revolted, publishing a special opinion section that called its owners “vulture capitalists,” adding, “If Alden isn’t willing to do good journalism here, it should sell The Post to owners who will.”Alden’s role in the news industry has only expanded since then. Last fall, the hedge fund revealed that it had become the largest shareholder in the Tribune Company, the publisher of The Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and The Baltimore Sun, among other dailies. Journalists in Chicago and Baltimore have made pleas to benefactors to buy their newspapers.Ken Doctor, a news media analyst, said Chatham Asset Management’s role in a post-bankruptcy McClatchy represented a significant shift in the American news business.“It ratifies the almost complete financialization of the American newspaper industry,” he said. “If Chatham takes control of McClatchy, you now have financial players from Alden to Fortress to Chatham controlling almost a majority of the nation’s daily press.”"

Fuld, who piloted the investment bank through prior crises with aplomb, was widely seen as too slow to recognize Lehmans need to raise capital and shed bad assets.Watch a discussion of Lehman on video at left.At the end of August, Lehman had $600 billion of assets financed with just $30 billion of equity.Having so little capital meant that a 5 percent decline in assets would wipe out the value of the company, which investors saw as a real risk due to the companys billions of dollars of mortgage securities.""Lehman decided to play chicken with the market and they lost,"" James Ellman, portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital, said late on Sunday.In its Chapter 11 filing, Lehman named Citibank and Bank of New York Mellon as trustees for about $138 billion of senior Lehman bonds. It said Citis Hong Kong affiliate had made a $275 million bank loan to Lehman.Among Lehmans other unsecured creditors are Japanese banks Aozora Bank, Mizuho Financial Group Inc, Shinsei Bank and UFJ Bank.Frances BNP Paribas is also on Lehmans list of its 30 largest unsecured creditors.The firm said that as of May 31, it owed about $110.5 billion on account of senior unsecured notes, $12.6 billion on account of subordinated unsecured notes, and $5 billion on account of junior subordinated notes.Lehman also disclosed that it owned stakes of 10 percent or more in a number of companies, including Imperial Sugar Co , Lpath Inc, Derma Services, Flagstone Reinsurance, GLG Partners, Ronco Corp , Pacific Energy Partners, Blount International , Pemstar Inc and Transmontaigne Inc.The investment bank, once the fourth-largest in the United States, had hoped to raise capital by selling off a stake in its investment unit, and use that capital as well as other funds to spin off some of its toxic assets to shareholders.But that plan did not satisfy investors, who punished Lehmans share price, or rating agencies, who pressed the company to find a stronger partner.Lehman said the uncertainty, particularly among banks through which it clears securities trades, ultimately made it impossible for it to continue to operate its business.The bankruptcy filing comes after a weekend of heated negotiations among regulators and Wall Street firms about Lehmans fate.The U.S. government refused to backstop Lehmans worst assets the way it backstopped Bear Stearns Cos Incs sale to JPMorgan Chase.Government officials told banks to support Lehman or else be prepared for more investment banks to lose investor confidence and fail.But prospective bidders refused to buy Lehman without government support, people briefed on the matter said.In the end, Lehman was allowed to fail, and Bank of America Corp agreed to buy what was seen as the next weakest U.S. investment bank, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc.For many of Lehmans 26,000 employees the outlook is likely to be gloomy, with job losses expected to be substantial even if significant parts of the business can be sold.At Lehmans headquarters in midtown Manhattan on Sunday afternoon, men dressed in suits came and went, while some employees entered the building with what appeared to be empty duffel bags, then left with them full.Others emerged with accordion files, binders stuffed with papers and full valises.On Sunday night, hundreds of Lehman employees were still in the office to clear their desks and pack personal belongings, according to an employee.Many opted to say their farewells with one last office soiree.

The filing, called an S-1, was expected. It was a crucial step in what up to that point had been an exquisitely choreographed march toward an initial public offering for the tech worlds most highly valued startup.With its stratospheric $47 billion valuation and preposterously ambitious cofounder and CEO, Adam Neumann — his goal wasnt merely to make money or rent office space, he claimed, but to ""change the world"" — WeWork had become a glaring symbol of Silicon Valleys boundless audacity and self-professed exemption from the laws of economics.In the early-morning light, thousands of investors and journalists would get their first real peek at the companys financial condition and be able to judge for themselves whether WeWork was really, as its founder claimed, on a path toward galactic dominance and unimaginable profit.Almost immediately, all hell broke loose. A steady stream of rapid-fire headlines detailed Neumanns self-dealing, mismanagement, and bizarre behavior. Within 33 days the offering was scuttled, WeWorks valuation plummeted 70% or more, and Neumann, who believed he would become the worlds first trillionaire, was ousted as CEO. What was supposed to be Neumanns coronation as a visionary became one of the most catastrophically bungled attempted debuts in business history.Read more: WeWorks board just ousted Adam Neumann as CEO — heres who the key players areIt wasnt supposed to be this way. WeWork was a unicorn, a near-invincible powerhouse flush with venture capital. The most brilliant minds in Silicon Valley and the most powerful global investors had shoveled billions of dollars into its coffers — how could it be anything but a sure bet? Validation from public-market investors was a mere formality.But two things had changed in the nine years since Neumann began constructing the myth of WeWork with the help of starry-eyed tech journalists and hungry investors: Theranos and Uber. In the fall of Theranos, the blood-testing company that imploded under accusations of fraud, the investing public saw how a multibillion-dollar valuation could be spun up from Silicon Valley bromides and the image of an idiosyncratic, enigmatic founder who inspired cult-like devotion. In Uber, whose stock has trended downward since it went public, they saw how machismo, hubris, and accounting tricks could obscure fundamental business challenges.Unfortunately for Neumann, it was precisely the wrong time to be the visionary leader of a company with imperial dreams and obscure finances. Patience had run out.This account of the six-week period since that August 14 filing is based on Business Insiders own reporting, as well as that of The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, The New York Times, Bloomberg, New York magazine, Vanity Fair, and other publications.The WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann. Jackal Pan / Getty Tech-bro mysticism, grueling hours, and Don Julio tequilaNeumann, a 40-year-old Israeli Navy veteran, is known for his signature look of long unkempt hair above a T-shirt and jeans and bold pronouncements bordering on the bizarre (""On the one hand, community,"" he once told New York magazine, describing his simultaneous desire for social cohesion and cutthroat competition. ""On the other hand, you eat what you kill."")He spent time on a kibbutz and has described his early life as troubled. His parents divorced when he was 7, and he moved 13 times as a kid and into his teens, according to a Reuters profile. He moved to New York in 2001, when he was 22, to live with his sister, a model, in Tribeca. He attended business school, ""hit on every girl in the city,"" and built failed businesses around collapsible womens high-heeled shoes and baby clothes with knee pads (""Krawlers"").WeWork, which now has 12,500 employees, had always been a little different. Neumann founded it in 2010 with Miguel McKelvey, who was raised on an Oregon commune. The bulk of the firms business is in renting out space in buildings and then sprucing it up and parceling out smaller chunks to freelancers, startups, and other businesses for shorter time frames. While WeWork typically takes out 15-year leases, some of its customers can move out in a month.It often seemed like a real-estate company posing as a higher plane of consciousness. Together with his wife, Rebekah, a devout follower of Kabbalah who is a cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, Neumann cultivated a sort of tech-bro mysticism, combining grueling hours and always-on expectations with a free flow of alcohol and hippie wisdom. Rebekah started a private elementary school and played up WeWorks community of tenant workers.Adam walked around the office barefoot. He once decreed that no one should eat meat in the office or purchase it on company expense accounts. He also partied hard: Neumann was known for drinking Don Julio 1942, the $149-a-bottle tequila. And he smoked marijuana in the office, at his various homes, and elsewhere, people whod seen him smoke it told Business Insider.The trappings of successThe trappings of success soon followed. In recent years, Neumann purchased at least five homes, including a $10.5 million Greenwich Village townhouse, another in the Hamptons, and yet another, a 60-acre estate, north of New York City. In 2017, he spent $35 million to buy four apartments in the same building in the tony Manhattan neighborhood of Gramercy Park. He purchased a $60 million Gulfstream jet for WeWork, which flew around the globe to London, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Hawaii, among other locations. Neumanns successors are moving to sell it.The companys prospectus reflected the Neumanns eccentricities. It opened with a dramatic pronouncement: ""We are a community company committed to maximum global impact. Our mission is to elevate the worlds consciousness."" The inside cover carried a dedication to ""the energy of we — greater than any of us but inside all of us."" It included a commitment from the Neumanns to donate $1 billion in cash and stock — wealth they hadnt earned yet — to charity as well as a pledge to save 20 million acres of rain forest.Rebekah Neumann wielded significant influence over the language in the filing — internally referred to by the codename ""Project Wingspan"" — according to two sources with knowledge of the process. It listed the companys underwriters in a circle instead of the customary pecking order. Months earlier, theyd changed the companys name from WeWork to just We, to better communicate the enormity of their ambitions. An earlier version of the prospectus listed a series of competitive advantages under the heading ""Our Superpowers.""Read more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumanns WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked itIf the WeWork IPO was supposed to be a validation of Neumanns grand spiritual plan, for his sponsor and largest backer, Masayoshi Son, the CEO of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, it would vindicate his controversial strategy of plowing billions of dollars into promising startups and pushing them to spend gobs of money to dominate their market. Son was out fundraising, even as some of his biggest investments, like the ride-hailing firm Uber, had failed to live up to expectations. This would be the stamp of approval he sorely needed.Son and Neumann had met for less than 30 minutes back in 2016 before Son decided to invest in WeWork. He would eventually pledge $10.7 billion, either from SoftBanks coffers or those of a separate vehicle established by Son called the Vision Fund, which raised $100 billion from backers including Saudi Arabia. After those investors balked at putting in any more money (Vanity Fair reported that Neumann arrived late and appeared hungover for an investor meeting), it was SoftBanks $2 billion investment round in January that secured WeWorks most recent $47 billion valuation.Bankers and investors had also bought into the hype. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were running the IPO — after dangling potential market caps as high as $63 billion and $96 billion.Representatives for Neumann, WeWork, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the record for this story. A representative for SoftBank did not immediately respond.SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters We have a history of lossesTrouble began almost as soon as the 359-page S-1 filing hit the internet. Investors, analysts, and journalists began digging in, and they didnt like what they found: a laundry list of potential conflicts between Neumann and the company, a byzantine corporate structure, and losses that were growing even as revenue doubled. The company didnt explain how it would become profitable. The section disclosing risks to investors ran to almost 30 pages.The potential conflicts were astounding: Neumann owned an interest in four buildings that WeWork leased. Hed gotten personal loans from the company at below-market rates to fund his lavish lifestyle. One, for $362 million, was connected to an early exercise of stock options (and has since been repaid). He had a $500 million line of credit secured by his shares. Perhaps most alarmingly, he had purchased the trademark to the ""We"" name through a holding company, and WeWork paid him $5.9 million to license it. ""Related party"" citations in the prospectus — disclosures that the company was doing business that could enrich an employee, director, or officer — numbered more than 100.Read more: WeWork details CEO Adam Neumanns web of loans, real-estate deals, and family involvement with the companyHed also used company money to fund what looked like pet projects, including several entities linked to Neumanns love of surfing. It led a $32 million investment into the surfer Laird Hamiltons startup, Laird Superfood, and sank $14 million into Wavegarden, a company that makes surfing-wave pools.Neumann had near total control. WeWork would have three classes of stock, including two that awarded Neumann 20 votes for each share. Upon death, his wife would have the power to name a new CEO, independently of the board.But perhaps what made WeWork different is the apparent problems with the companys business model. It was on the hook for $47 billion in future lease payments to building owners while having committed revenue of only $4 billion. Last years loss jumped to $1.9 billion on revenue of $1.8 billion — for every dollar it made, it was spending two. For the first half of this year, losses climbed to $904 million even as revenue doubled to $1.54 billion. The company also used a made-up metric that it called ""contribution margin"" — renamed from the ""community-adjusted Ebitda"" that was much maligned earlier in the year — that made it harder to understand how the underlying business was performing.""We have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level,"" the firm said in its filing, ""for the foreseeable future.""Read more: WeWork might be painting itself as a tech company, but its facing a bunch of old-school real-estate worriesIt was a lot to take in. By the end of that day, both the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal were suggesting that the company might have to reduce its valuation to attract interest. Analysts quickly joined the fray, with Fitch Ratings moving that day to downgrade the company lower into junk territory over its profligate spending, among other factors.If that werent enough, Neumann got another bad omen: Faraday Grid, a UK-based startup looking to build new power transformers into which Neumann had invested 25 million pounds earlier this year, filed for bankruptcy.It was less than 24 hours since the companys filing had been made public.A masterpiece of obfuscationTriton Researchs Rett Wallace would later call the prospectus a ""masterpiece of obfuscation.""The New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway wrote a takedown of the company titled ""WeWTF."" John Coffee, a Columbia University professor who directs the universitys corporate-governance center, told the Financial Times that to navigate past investor concerns about the companys structure, market volatility, and a tougher climate for IPOs, Neumann would have to ""go through an ordeal of fire.""Read more: WeWork opened 400 locations in 3 years. In some cases, it used deep discounts to convince existing customers to relocate to help fill them.While some of the companys advisers were surprised at the speed and depth of the negative reaction, according to a person familiar with their thoughts, WeWork execs remained bullish on the companys prospects throughout that week and into the summer weekend. WeWorks bonds rallied by more than 3% on hopes that the IPO would pay off.But the brutal headlines kept coming: On Monday, August 19, the Financial Times editorial board blasted WeWork and Neumann for the lock he kept on the company. The title was ""Beware the dead hand of the controlling founder."" In The New York Times, Kara Swisher asked, ""WeWork: Is there any there there?"" Another Financial Times opinion article led with ""WeWorks magical thinking disguises a flawed model.""""Hype is one of the tech sectors most magical qualities,"" Elaine Moore wrote in the Financial Times. ""Like Uber and Lyft, no one can say for sure whether its business actually works.""The companys advisers continued to survey investors, trying to drum up support for an IPO they hoped would raise at least $3 billion. They werent getting a positive reception. Shortly after 4 p.m. on Monday, August 26, Neumann hopped on the WeWork Gulfstream for a 13-hour red-eye flight over the arctic to Tokyo to speak with SoftBank investors about the state of the IPO.The discussion centered on two possibilities: whether SoftBank would be a big buyer of shares in the IPO, which would be hotly debated for weeks after, or whether the Japanese conglomerate might inject a new slug of operating cash so WeWork could delay the offering.The talks ignited a long-simmering difference of opinion within SoftBank, where some execs had argued against investing any more money into the company. Son, however, remained committed to Neumann and his vision. And he held considerable sway. Neumann needed the money — $9 billion in IPO proceeds and bank debt — to fuel his continuing global ambitions.We cofounder and CEO Adam Neumann Getty A humiliating comedownBut by early September, something had to give. WeWorks bankers werent having any luck drumming up enough support for the IPO, hearing from investors concerned about signs of Neumanns self-dealing and skepticism about the business model.On Wednesday, September 4, the retrenchment began. Neumann agreed to return the $5.9 million payment he had gotten from WeWork for the rights to use the trademarked term ""We."" The company also announced that Frances Frei, a Harvard professor and adviser to the company since March, would join the board, responding to criticism about its lack of a single woman. Newspapers reported the company was preparing to kick off its IPO road show as soon as the following week.But the next day, another drumbeat of negative news about valuation flooded the media. While some had suggested early on that the companys lofty valuation might need to be trimmed, things had gone quiet as advisers canvassed investors. No more.Numerous outlets reported the company was considering selling shares at 50% of its most recent private valuation, or $20 billion to $30 billion. Yet some company insiders still hoped to be able to get something in the range of $25 billion to $30 billion.It was a humiliating comedown from the hype that had followed the company and Neumann for years. Any lower and WeWork would be forced to wear the ignominious crown of Silicon Valleys biggest-ever public down round.The reasons for the knockdown were well publicized, though members of WeWorks camp tried mightily to paint it as a prudent step: The Financial Times said the firms underwriters were worried about listing the company at too high a valuation and risking a repeat of what happened with Uber, which has fallen about 33% since its debut.Desperately trying to keep the IPO on trackBy Sunday, September 8, the company was considering a valuation below the $20 billion that had been floated just days before. WeWork had been planning to begin its road show the following day, and yet the company and its advisers were still holding meetings to see what they could do to drum up more demand.By Monday, if not before, SoftBank decided it had seen enough. Executives at the conglomerate and its $100 billion Vision Fund were pushing Neumann to abandon the IPO.For SoftBank, it was a stunning reversal. After plowing more than $10 billion into the company, and taking a 29% stake, the firm and its leader, Son, needed a big win. Yet it couldnt stomach a public-market valuation just one-third of the private value it had given WeWork as recently as January.By Thursday, September 12, WeWork was considering reducing Neumanns voting power from 20 votes a share to 10 votes in an effort to win over investors. Neumann was ""desperately"" trying to keep the IPO on track. WeWork canceled a planned town hall.Friday was a big day. WeWork was hoping to begin its road show the following week, and it made another attempt to woo investors with changes to corporate governance. The company publicly announced changes that day, taking the steps the Financial Times previewed, and made numerous other changes at the same time. The company cited ""market feedback"" for the adjustments and said no member of Neumanns family would sit on the board. The plan for Rebekah Neumann to choose a successor in the event of her husbands death was also scrapped, and the filing said the board had the ability to remove the CEO.Reuters reported the company was looking at a valuation of $10 billion to $12 billion. That would value the company at less than the $12.8 billion in total equity it raised during its nine years of operations.Neumann remained committed to going forward with the IPO, hoping to complete the listing before Rosh Hashanah so he could observe the Jewish High Holidays. In talks earlier that week with SoftBank, the CEO said he didnt expect any changes over the coming 12 months and what he really needed was more cash to fund his plans for expansion. Neumann was also counting on a $6 billion loan that his bankers would give to WeWork — but only if he successfully raised at least $3 billion in the IPO. Later that Friday, the firm announced plans to list on the Nasdaq.The interplay between Neumann and his advisers was fraught throughout the process, according to people familiar with the matter. The CEO resisted some of his advisers suggested changes to the IPO filing, particularly around the control and voting structures, one of the people said. And JPMorgan insisted on disclosing some of the related-party transactions that would later prompt the investor backlash. Neumann wasnt even listening to his largest sponsor, SoftBank, who wanted to shelve the IPO.He plowed ahead, and SoftBank had little choice but to go along with the plans of the man they had invested so heavily in. By Friday afternoon, news reports suggested that SoftBank was prepared to act as the anchor investor in the IPO, purchasing at least $750 million in shares in the offering.Heading into the weekend, WeWork, SoftBank, and its advisers were hoping that the corporate-governance changes, valuation markdowns, and pledge of SoftBank support would be enough to launch the long-awaited road show.It would be some of the longest 48 hours of Adam Neumanns life.FILE PHOTO: The WeWork logo is displayed on the entrance of a co-working space in New York Reuters A bombshell hitsBy Monday, instead of starting the road show, WeWork announced plans to postpone the listing until after the Jewish holidays. Even with SoftBanks anchor investment, the company and its advisers had decided it would still raise less than the $3 billion it needed to unlock the $6 billion loan that it needed to keep operating.The company issued a terse statement that said it looked forward to completing the IPO by the end of the year. Any further delay beyond that, and the clock would run out on the terms of the loan, which would have to be renegotiated.The day after shelving the IPO, Neumann acknowledged in an internal webcast to being humbled. It was a new low for the founder. He now realized, he told his employees, that the skills hed developed to run a private company would need to be adapted to run a public corporation. By this point, members of the board had begun thinking about how they could force him to resign, according to multiple reports.Shortly after noon, the bombshell hit.The Wall Street Journals Eliot Brown dropped a 2,864-word, deeply reported article detailing Neumanns frequent marijuana use and propensity for shots of tequila. The newspaper told of a flight to Israel in which the owner of the jet recalled it after finding marijuana in the cabin. And of a layoffs discussion followed with tequila shots and a performance by a member of Run-DMC.The article was a turning point in how his investors and employees saw him, according to a person with knowledge of those views. In the coverage that followed across news organizations, the CEOs marijuana use would be frequently mentioned.Sliding toward possible bankruptcyThat was it. By Sunday, SoftBank was pushing to unseat Neumann. Faced with allegations of drug use, erratic behavior, and earlier defiance in pursuing the IPO even after his largest investor cautioned patience, SoftBank had lost faith. Some large investors had said they wouldnt invest unless the company brought in a more experienced executive. Several investors even thought of threatening the CEO with legal steps related to his self-dealing. A board meeting was scheduled for later in the week.Read more: JPMorgans Jamie Dimon met with WeWorks Adam Neumann this weekend to hash out how to get its botched IPO back on trackThat Sunday, Neumann sat down with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, whom he liked to call his personal banker. Like the consigliere J. Pierpont Morgan a century before, Dimon found himself in the midst of the biggest corporate story of the moment. The two men discussed what could be done to get the delayed IPO back on track, Business Insider first reported. Dimon also brokered talks with Neumanns advisers over the course of two days at the banks midtown headquarters, a person familiar with them said.Dimon was more than a neutral ear. In addition to serving as the banks top IPO adviser, JPMorgan has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Neumann. WeWork disclosed Neumanns $500 million personal line of credit from JPMorgan, UBS, and Credit Suisse, $380 million of which had been drawn down. The CEO had another $98 million from JPMorgan in the form of mortgages and other loans. WeWork was part of Dimons plan to supplant the duopoly of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley running techs hottest IPOs.Later that Sunday, Neumann had dinner with Bruce Dunlevie, one of WeWorks earliest directors and a partner at the investor Benchmark Capital, to discuss his options. Dunlevie and Dimon had been supporting Neumanns desire to remain as CEO, but no more: Dunlevie broke the news to Neumann at that dinner that he was siding with SoftBank. He wanted Neumann out. A representative for Benchmark Capital declined to comment.On Tuesday, September 24, as Neumanns fate hung in the balance, WeWorks board assembled at JPMorgans Madison Avenue headquarters. The octagonal building found itself at the center of corporate Americas biggest debacle once again after hosting last-ditch efforts to salvage Bear Stearns before the 2008 financial crisis hit its nadir. On floors that towered over Grand Central Terminal, WeWorks board met for hours to discuss what to do. By the time the members emerged from the skyscrapers granite walls, Neumann had been voted out. In the end, Neumann voted against himself.He would step down and become nonexecutive chairman. He had lost control of the company and watched his voting power reduced to three votes a share, giving him a minority of votes. He can nominate only a minority of directors.In a statement, Neumann told employees that ""since the announcement of our IPO, too much of the focus has been placed on me.""Read more: Adam Neumann is out as WeWorks CEO, but thats no silver bullet: VCs and proptech experts think it will take cutting passion projects and cleaning house to right the shipThe board named the WeWork executives Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson to replace Neumann, and the company began considering such unthinkable options such as slowing its growth, cutting thousands of employees to focus on its core business of renting office space, and getting rid of side businesses such as Rebekah Neumanns school to control costs and — perhaps — restore investor confidence. When asked recently to respond to concerns about its business model, the company said it intended to fully honor its lease commitments.The company began to formalize talks for a renegotiated loan of about $3 billion, which was expected to require the raising of additional equity.The Economist publicly wondered whether anything could be done to halt what it called ""WeWorks slide towards possible bankruptcy.""By Thursday, SoftBank was talking about another injection of $1 billion.Additional reporting by Meghan Morris, J.K.

Crew, the apparel seller known for its preppy clothing, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the first major retailer to fail amid widespread business shutdowns across the U.S. aimed at containing the coronavirus.In a statement on Monday, J. Crew said its Madewell store chain will remain part of the J. Crew Group. It added that its ecommerce businesses, which contribute more than half of the companys sales, will continue to operate. It also plans to reopen stores as soon as stay-at-home orders and other health restrictions related to COVID-19 are lifted.Even before the pandemic shuttered much of the economy, J. Crew was struggling with changes in consumer tastes. It was also saddled with a debt load stemming from its $3 billion leveraged buyout in 2011 by private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, which one analyst cited as a major factor in its financial distress.The companys $1.7 billion of long-term debt ""sits on the companys balance sheet like a millstone around its neck,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a research note. ""Quite simply this is crippling the business which, at operating level, is profitable.""The pandemic has proven catastrophic for many retailers that were forced to shut their doors, with J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus expected to follow J.Crew in filing for bankruptcy protection. In J. Crews case, the pandemic ""forced the situation to a head,"" Saunders noted.Clothing store sales plummeted more than 50% in March, according to Commerce Department data, and it has grown worse since. Jeans maker True Religion Apparel filed for bankruptcy protection last month.But longer-term issues are facing the brand, including consumers lackluster reception to its clothing line, Saunders said. While Chapter 11 will give J. Crew a financial breather, the company will need to reinvent its brand to draw shoppers back through its doors, both online or in stores, he added.""Ranges are samey and lack the embellishments and twists of more contemporary brands that would allow them to stand out,"" he said. ""The consequence of this is that a growing number of shoppers see J. Crew as both boring and bad value for money and refuse to pay full price for garments."""
