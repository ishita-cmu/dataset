Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Turkiyes-ratings-to-B3-changes-outlook-to-stable--PR_468377,"Moody's downgrades Turkiye's ratings to B3, changes outlook to stable","London, August 12, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today downgraded the Government of Turkiyes long-term foreign- and domestic-currency issuer and the foreign-currency senior unsecured ratings to B3 from B2.The foreign-currency senior unsecured shelf rating was downgraded to (P)B3 from (P)B2. Concurrently, the foreign-currency backed senior unsecured rating of Hazine Mustesarligi Varlik Kiralama A.S., a special purpose vehicle wholly owned by the Republic of Turkiye from which the Treasury issues sukuk certificates, was also downgraded to B3 from B2. The outlook is changed to stable from negative for both issuers.The downgrade to B3 reflects the following key drivers:1. Rising pressures on Turkiyes balance of payments with risks of a further depletion of foreign-currency reserves. Turkiyes current account deficit will likely exceed earlier expectations by a wide margin, raising external financing needs at a time of tightening financial conditions globally;2. The authorities are having to resort to increasingly unorthodox measures in an attempt to stabilize the currency and restore foreign-currency buffers. Inflation has risen to its highest levels for over two decades and will likely trend higher in the coming months, on the back of surging energy and food prices and also reflecting the unwillingness of the Central Bank of Turkiye (CBRT) to raise its policy rate. In Moodys view, it is unlikely that the increasingly complex set of regulatory, fiscal and macroprudential measures will be effective in restoring some degree of macroeconomic stability. Moodys considers this a Governance driver under its ESG framework.The stable outlook reflects Moodys view that the risks at the B3 level are balanced. While the authorities highly unorthodox economic policies will likely exacerbate the current economic imbalances, the sovereign has relatively low external debt and moderate refinancing needs for the remainder of the year and next year.Concurrently Moodys lowered Turkiyes local-currency country ceiling to B1 from Ba3 previously. The two-notch gap between the local-currency ceiling and the sovereign rating mainly balances a relatively limited government footprint in the economy with unpredictable institutions and government actions, elevated domestic and geopolitical political risks and significant external imbalances. The foreign-currency ceiling was lowered to B3 from B2. The two-notch gap between the foreign-currency ceiling and the local-currency ceiling mainly reflects weak policy effectiveness as well as the low level of foreign currency reserves, which leads to elevated transfer and convertibility risks.RATINGS RATIONALERATIONALE FOR RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO B3FIRST DRIVER: RISING PRESSURES ON THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTSTurkiyes external position is under greater than expected pressure, mainly as a result of surging energy prices, which are pushing up already high inflation and raising external financing needs. The countrys current account deficit will likely be close to 6% of GDP this year, more than three times larger than expected before Russias invasion of Ukraine (Caa3 negative) on 24 February, and much higher than last years deficit of 1.7% of GDP.Declining foreign-currency reserves are a further pressure point. While strong tourism and goods export performance provide important foreign-currency revenues, those inflows will start to slow in the autumn months, while net energy imports will likely remain very high. At that point, Moodys expects pressure on the exchange rate and the CBRTs foreign-currency buffer to increase again. Hard-currency reserves have recently risen to $67.7 billion as of early August (excluding gold reserves valued at $40.8 billion), helped by a large inflow linked to a large energy project. But reserves have been declining for most of the year although the introduction of the deposit protection scheme, intended to incentivize depositors to shift into lira-denominated deposits and away from hard-currency deposits, and the requirement for exporters to convert 40% of their export earnings into lira with the CBRT, should have led to materially stronger reserve buffers. Excluding borrowed reserves in the form of swaps with banks and banks reserve requirements net reserves are negative to the tune of $50 billion.External financing needs are large at around $250 billion or 34% of GDP this year, of which half is short-term debt that has typically been rolled over such as trade credit or is in the form of stable non-resident deposits in the banking system. Moodys estimates confidence-sensitive external refinancing needs at around $128 billion or 17% of GDP, primarily owed by the private sector. In contrast, the government has only one external bond maturity left in September for $2.5 billion plus interest and loan repayments of a further $3.2 billion from July-December, which could be covered out of its foreign-currency deposits at the CBRT of around $11 billion in case of tighter financing conditions.SECOND DRIVER: INCREASINGLY UNORTHODOX MEASURES ARE UNLIKELY TO RESTORE MACROECONOMIC STABILITYInflation has accelerated to 79.6% in July, compared to below 20% in October last year and is now among the highest levels reported globally. The Turkish lira has lost around 30% of its value against the US dollar this year, following a depreciation of around 45% over the last two months of 2021, which was triggered by a series of CBRT interest rate cuts. The currency remains under pressure, which points to continuing high inflation in the coming months. According to Moodys latest forecasts, consumer price inflation will still stand at close to 70% at year-end.The authorities have taken a series of measures since the start of the year, with the aim to stabilise the currency, rebuild the central banks low foreign-currency reserve buffer and more recently engineer a ""soft"" landing of the economy by reigning in credit growth. New measures have been announced ever more frequently and have become increasingly unorthodox, such as the requirement for exporters to convert 40% of their export earnings into lira with the CBRT and the prohibition for banks to extend credit to firms holding material foreign-currency assets. So far, the measures have not been successful in stabilising the currency and materially raising the CBRTs foreign-exchange buffers. Other measures focus on directing credit to specific sectors and activities, such as exporting companies and loans for investment, rather than consumption. There are early signs of a slowdown in credit growth. Also, bank lending rates have risen to over 30% in recent weeks, significantly above the CBRTs policy rate at 14%, which should help to dampen demand for credit.However, in Moodys view it is unlikely that the increasingly complex set of regulatory and macroprudential measures will be effective in restoring some degree of macroeconomic stability and sustainably help to bring down inflation. While Moodys expects a gradual economic slowdown in the second half of this year and into next year  the rating agency forecasts real GDP growth of 4.5% and 2% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, the risk of a sharper slowdown is material. The global environment has become significantly more challenging, as financial conditions have tightened globally and Turkiyes main export markets in Europe face a slowdown in growth amid an energy crisis and continued supply chain challenges. A sharp slowdown would negatively impact the labour market, the strength of public finances and raise social and political risks. External refinancing options  important for the private sector as the main borrower abroad  might become more constrained if the economy slows sharply. At the same time, it is unclear whether there is political acceptance that the Turkish economy will need to slow down, in particular in light of the approaching elections, which will have to be held by June 2023 at the latest.Moodys expects a material weakening of Turkiyes public finances this year. While public finances have remained solid in the first half of the year, supported by a doubling of government revenues as a result of high inflation, budgetary pressures will likely increase materially in the latter months of the year. The cost to the Treasury of the deposit protection scheme is rising, with Moodys estimating the full-year cost at around 2.2% of GDP, on the basis of the rating agencys exchange rate forecasts. As of June, the Treasury has paid out 0.3% of GDP. Similarly, the cost of inflation-indexed debt which is mostly held by domestic banks has risen substantially, and Moodys estimates that high inflation will add around 1.2% of GDP in interest payments this year compared to 2021. The rating agency expects a budget deficit of around 4.5% of GDP, also reflecting the slowdown in the economy, a higher wage and public-sector pension bill as well as earlier tax reductions. Debt affordability is deteriorating rapidly, with the ratio of interest payments to revenue expected to rise to 10.2% this year, the highest level since 2010, and further in the coming years.RATIONALE FOR STABLE OUTLOOKThe outlook on the B3 rating is stable, mainly reflecting Moodys view that at this rating level Turkiyes credit challenges are fully incorporated. Despite the expected increase in the budget deficit, the governments debt burden will remain moderate compared to peers at below 40% of GDP (general government level) this year. The central governments external debt stock is low at less than 20% of GDP. While the governments debt is highly exposed to currency depreciation  around 67% of the central governments outstanding debt stock is linked to or denominated in foreign currencies as of June 2022  still strong nominal GDP growth should continue to compensate to a large extent for currency deprecation. Despite last years large depreciation, the debt ratio increased by just 2.4 percentage points of GDP. The government borrows predominantly domestically, where its borrowing costs are deeply negative in real terms, and more than three quarters of the debt is held by resident banks. Foreign investors hold just 1% of domestically issued debt as of June, which limits the impact of a further loss of foreign investor confidence.Banks and corporates  the main borrowers abroad  have been able to roll over maturing debt during previous periods of financial stress and have not encountered any difficulties so far this year and have well-hedged foreign-currency positions, which provides a cushion against future episodes of financial stress.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSTurkiyes ESG credit impact score is highly negative (CIS-4), reflecting material exposure to a number of environmental and social risks and a weak institutional environment.Turkiyes environmental issuer profile score is moderately negative (E-3), reflecting exposure to environmental risks across a range of categories, such as water supply, natural capital, and waste and pollution. Turkiye is vulnerable to water stress and it has experienced reductions in winter precipitation in the western part of the country over the past half century, which can have an impact on the quantity and quality of water in the countrys rivers, which are an important source of drinking water, irrigation, and power generation.Turkiyes social IPS is also moderately negative (S-3). While the countrys young population supports its demographic profile, youth unemployment is high, labour force participation is low and informality is widespread. High inflation is eroding living standards, with 15% of the population at-risk of poverty in 2020, adding to social risks. The overall provision of basic services such as safe drinking water and sanitation services to the population is uneven across the country.Turkiyes institutions and governance profile has deteriorated steadily in recent years and has been a key driver of successive downgrades to the sovereigns rating. This is captured by a highly negative governance IPS (G-4).The publication of this rating action deviates from the previously scheduled release dates in the UK sovereign calendar published on https://ratings.moodys.com. This action was prompted by heightened macroeconomic risks following very high and still increasing inflation numbers in the first half of 2022, and comes against the backdrop of a much more challenging external environment given an expected economic slowdown in key trading partners and tighter global financing conditions.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 34,755 (2021) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): 11% (2021) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 36.1% (2021)Gen. Gov. Financial Balance/GDP: -3.4% (2021) (also known as Fiscal Balance)Current Account Balance/GDP: -1.7% (2021) (also known as External Balance)External debt/GDP: 54.4% (2021)Economic resiliency: ba1Default history: At least one default event (on bonds and/or loans) has been recorded since 1983.On 09 August 2022, a rating committee was called to discuss the rating of the Turkiye, Government of. The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuers economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have not materially changed. The issuers institutions and governance strength, have not materially changed. The issuers fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has not materially changed. The issuers susceptibility to event risks, in particular political event risk, has materially changed.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADEThe ratings could be upgraded if Turkiyes policymakers refocused on reducing inflation through decisive and clear monetary policy actions that restored confidence in the CBRT. A sustained reduction in the external imbalance would also be positive for the rating, if it was the result of an improvement in Turkiyes external competitiveness and economic resilience.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADEThe ratings would likely be downgraded further if the authorities resorted to ever more coercive policy measures that raise the risk of a banking crisis or payment defaults by large corporations. A further material deterioration in the external balance would also be negative, as would evidence that inflation remains persistently high, implying a further increase in social risks. Furthermore, a severe political crisis following the next elections that brought on acute economic and financial disruptions would also be credit negative. Expectations that government debt would rise materially, with a related deterioration in debt affordability, would also put downward pressure on the rating.PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/63168.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Credit-Suisse-Group-AGs-senior-unsecured-debt-ratings--PR_468210,Moody's downgrades Credit Suisse Group AG's senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2; outlook negative,"Credit Suisse AGs senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings downgraded to A2 and negative outlook maintainedLondon, August 01, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") today downgraded the senior unsecured debt ratings of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSG) by one notch to Baa2 from Baa1. At the same time, the rating agency downgraded the long-term senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings of Credit Suisse AG (CS) by one notch to A2 from A1.The negative outlook on these ratings has been maintained.The rating agency further downgraded CSs Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) and Adjusted BCA to baa3 from baa2 and its long-term Counterparty Risk Assessment to A2(cr) from A1(cr). The long-term senior unsecured debt, issuer as well as deposit ratings of all of CSs subsidiaries - where applicable - have also been downgraded by one notch to A2 from A1. All short-term ratings were affirmed.Please click on this link https://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_ARFTL468319 for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral part of this Press Release and identifies each affected issuer.RATINGS RATIONALE--- DOWNGRADE OF THE BCA AND LONG-TERM RATINGS OF CREDIT SUISSE AGThe downgrade of CSs BCA, as well as its long-term ratings, reflects Moodys updated view on CSs credit profile as well as unchanged support for creditors under Moodys Advanced Loss Given Failure (Advanced LGF) analysis, which is applied to banks operating in jurisdictions with Operational Resolution Regimes.The downgrade of CSs ratings reflects (1) the challenges the group is facing in successfully executing on its previously announced repositioning of its investment bank in the more difficult macroeconomic and market environment as well as uncertainty as to the business and financial implications of the groups plans to take further steps to achieve a more stable, capital light and better aligned investment banking business ; (2) the crystallisation of large financial losses during H1 2022, resulting in stress on the banks financial profile and potential delays in technology investments and in the transformation of the business and an expectation of continued weak performance in 2022; (3) evidence of market share erosion and franchise impairment in the Investment Bank division, following deleveraging in capital-intensive businesses, exit from the prime brokerage business; and (4) the lengthy and resource-consuming risk, compliance and cultural remediation efforts that have progressed but are still underway; and (5) stabilising the group under the leadership of a new board and senior executive team will require time. These factors are partially mitigated by the firms solid - although decreasing - capitalisation and strong liquidity and funding profiles.Moodys considers weaknesses in CSs strategy, risk frameworks and controls, and compliance as a governance factors under its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. Moodys reflects such governance deficiencies, in CSs very highly negative Governance Issuer Profile Score (G-5), one notch lower than the previous G-4, driven by a Financial Strategy and Risk management category score of 5 (very highly negative), from the previous 4. Moodys changed CSs ESG Credit Impact Score to CIS-5 (very highly negative) from CIS-4 (highly negative), whereby its governance risks have a very highly negative impact on current ratings.The uncertainties regarding the banks ability to successfully execute on the previously announced as well as yet to be defined restructuring strategy, governance deficiencies and top management instability, are captured by a one-notch downward adjustment for Corporate Behavior in CSs scorecard. The BCA is now positioned middle of the range (from top of the range), recognising continuing challenges and downside pressures on the groups solvency metrics.--- DOWNGRADE OF THE LONG TERM DEBT RATINGS of CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AGThe downgrade of Credit Suisse Group AGs ratings reflects the downgrade of the ratings of its major subsidiary, Credit Suisse AG, as well as unchanged support for creditors under Moodys Advanced LGF framework.--- NEGATIVE OUTLOOKThe negative outlook on CSs senior unsecured debt, long-term issuer and deposit ratings and on CSGs senior unsecured debt, reflects Moodys view of: (1) the challenge the group is facing in successfully executing on the previously announced organizational and cultural remediation efforts in the more difficult macroeconomic and market environment and the business and financial uncertainties in relation to the implications of further repositioning of the investment bank; (2) the potential for a deterioration of the capital position below the company guidance of a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13-14%; (3) the risk that further large litigation charges may materialise in the medium term, further delaying a return to profitability; (4) a potential for a further deterioration of the asset risk profile of the group, driven by increased operational and execution risk; and (5) the potential for a substantial franchise impairment in the Investment Bank division, following aggressive deleveraging.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSAlthough unlikely at present, given the negative outlook, the long-term ratings could be upgraded if CS: (1) maintains its solid capital position and liquidity and overall franchise during the restructuring period; (2) successfully executes on the restructuring plan, in particular the transition to a capital-light, advisory-led investment banking business and more focused markets business as evidenced by a sustainable improvement in its profitability by successfully increasing the share of revenue generated from the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank businesses, while returning to profits in its Investment Bank; (3) demonstrates that it has fully addressed and remediated the significant corporate governance, risk, audit or compliance control shortcomings; and (4) stabilizes the top management team.The ratings could be downgraded if: (1) the capital position consistently remains below the Common Equity Tier 1 guidance of around 13-14%; (2) CS suffers sustained client or franchise impairment in its Investment Bank or Wealth Management divisions leading to the group being loss making beyond 2023; (3) definition and implementation of the revised and as yet undefined strategic plan is further delayed or deemed creditor unfriendly; (4) existing legacy litigations crystallise into large unexpected losses further negatively impacting profitability; (and (5) enhancements of the banks risk appetite, frameworks and controls fail to be successfully implemented.The ratings could further be downgraded should there be a significant and larger-than-anticipated decrease in the banks existing stock of loss-absorbing liabilities. Although regarded highly unlikely at present, this may lead to fewer notches of rating uplift as a result of Moodys Advanced LGF analysis.PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Banks Methodology published in July 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/71997.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Strathcona-Resources-B2-CFR-outlook-still-positive-following--PR_468330,Moody's affirms Strathcona Resources' B2 CFR; outlook still positive following acquisition,"Toronto, July 29, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) has affirmed all of Strathcona Resources Ltd.s (Strathcona) ratings, including its B2 corporate family rating (CFR), its B2-PD probability of default rating, and the B3 rating on its senior unsecured notes. The outlook remains positive.On July 27, 2022, Strathcona entered into an agreement with Serafina Energy Ltd. (Serafina) to acquire all the outstanding shares of Serafina for cash consideration of C$2.3 billion. A payment of C$1.9 billion will be made at closing on August 29, 2022, and deferred payments of C$100 million will be made on each of September 30, 2022, October 31, 2022, November 30, 2022 and December 30, 2022. The acquisition will be funded through borrowings on Strathconas revolving credit facility, with total committed borrowing capacity increased to C$2 billion (from C$1.5 billion), and through a C$700 million term loan. Serafina is an exploration and production company that produces about 40,000 bbls/d (before royalties) primarily through thermal heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan.""The affirmation and maintenance of the positive outlook reflects Strathconas sizable production and reserve base pro forma for the complimentary Serafina acquisition,"" said Moodys analyst Paresh Chari. ""The affirmation also reflects that financial leverage will remain solid despite the acquisition being entirely debt funded because Strathcona will use free cash flow to reduce debt.""Affirmations:..Issuer: Strathcona Resources Ltd..... Corporate Family Rating, Affirmed B2.... Probability of Default Rating, Affirmed B2-PD....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Affirmed B3 (LGD5)Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Strathcona Resources Ltd.....Outlook, Remains PositiveRATINGS RATIONALEStrathconas rating benefits from: 1) good credit metrics that should improve over the next 12-18 months with the company using free cash flow to reduce debt and improve retained cash flow to debt towards 50% in 2023; 2) majority of production from heavy oil and oil sands assets that have low decline rates (around 20%) that requires a low level of capital to sustain production; and 3) a sizable production (about 150,000 boe/d) and proved developed reserve (175 million boe) base pro forma for the acquisition. The companys rating is constrained by: 1) its limited operating history and rapid growth through acquisitions, which leads to greater financial and operating uncertainty as well as execution risks associated with the companys plan to grow production organically; 2) its exposure to heavy oil that is benchmarked to the historically volatile Western Canadian heavy oil price; and 3) an aggressive funding for the acquisition that utilizes a high proportion of committed credit capacity and an 18 month term loan that limits Strathconas financial flexibility.Strathconas liquidity is significantly diminished by the acquisition, but is adequate. Proforma for the Serafina acquisition and new debt instruments, Moodys expects minimal cash and about C$200 million of availability under its C$2 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in February 2026). Moodys expects about $450 million of free cash flow through to mid-2023 using Moodys medium term price assumptions and much higher if current market prices were to persist. Strathcona will also need to fund the deferred payments of C$400 million from September to December 2022 which Moodys expects will be funded using revolver availability and free cash flow. Strathconas new term loan is subject to a cash flow sweep provision that sweeps 100% of free cash flow until the term loan balance falls by 50%, and then the cash flow sweep declines to 50%. Moodys expects Strathcona will be in compliance with its three financial covenants through to mid-2023. Alternate liquidity is limited, as all assets are pledged to the first lien credit facilities, but only 50% of the asset sale proceeds are required to repay the term loan.Strathconas unsecured notes are rated B3, one notch below the companys B2 CFR. Moodys Loss Given Default for Speculative-Grade Companies (LGD) methodology suggests that the notes be ranked two notches below Strathconas B2 CFR due to the size and priority ranking of the companys C$2 billion first lien revolver and C$700 million first lien term loan due 2024 (revolver and term loan are pari passu) relative to the unsecured US$500 million notes due 2026 in the companys capital structure. However, given the positive outlook on Strathconas CFR, strong asset coverage, Moodys views the assigned B3 rating as more appropriate. If the CFR is upgraded to B1, then the notes rating is likely to remain B3 absent unanticipated changes to the capital structure. However, if the CFR remains B2 and the outlook changed to stable, the notes rating is likely to be downgraded.The positive outlook is supported by Moodys expectation that Strathconas credit metrics and liquidity will improve with debt reduction funded by free cash flow and that production will modestly grow over the next 12 to 18 months.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe ratings could be upgraded if Strathcona is able successfully operate the acquired assets, organically grow production at competitive costs while maintaining positive free cash flow, if retained cash flow (RCF)-to-debt is sustained above 30%, and the LFCR is sustained above 1.5x.The ratings could be downgraded if RCF-to-debt is below 15%, if the LFCR is below 1x, or Strathconas liquidity profile deteriorates either as a result of sustained negative free cash flow or from cash distributions to the companys PE owners.Strathcona Resources Ltd. is an oil and gas producer headquartered in Calgary Alberta, with producing assets located across Western Canada.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-provisional-ratings-to-Upstart-Securitization-Trust-2022-4--PR_468188,Moody's assigns provisional ratings to Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4,"Approximately $179 million of asset-backed securities ratedNew York, August 10, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has assigned provisional ratings to the notes to be issued by Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4 (""UPST 2022-4""), the fourth personal loan securitization issued from the UPST shelf this year. The collateral backing UPST 2022-4 consists of unsecured consumer installment loans originated by Cross River Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank and FinWise Bank, a Utah state-chartered commercial bank, all utilizing the Upstart Program, respectively. Upstart Network, Inc. (""Upstart"") will act as the servicer of the loans.The complete rating actions are as follows:Issuer: Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4Class A Notes, Assigned (P)A3 (sf)Class B Notes, Assigned (P)Ba2 (sf)RATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings are based on the quality of the underlying collateral and its expected performance, the strength of the capital structure and fast amortization of the assets, the experience and expertise of Upstart as servicer, and the back-up servicing arrangement with Wilmington Trust, National Association (""Wilmington"") and its designated sub-agent, Systems & Services Technologies, Inc. (S&ST unrated).Moodys median cumulative net loss expectation for the 2022-4 pool is 16.9% and the stress loss is 58.0%. Moodys based its cumulative net loss expectation on an analysis of the credit quality of the underlying collateral; the historical performance of similar collateral, including securitization performance and managed portfolio performance; the ability of Upstart to perform its servicing functions; the ability of Wilmington and its sub-agent to perform the backup servicing functions; and current expectations for the macroeconomic environment during the life of the transaction.At closing, the Class A and Class B notes are expected to benefit from 32.5% and 20.5% of hard credit enhancement respectively. Hard credit enhancement for the notes consists of a combination of overcollateralization, a non-declining reserve account and subordination for the Class A notes. The notes may also benefit from excess spread.The social risk for this transaction is high. Marketplace lenders have attracted elevated levels of regulatory attention at the state and federal level. As such, regulatory and borrower challenges to marketplace lenders and their third-party lending partners over ""true lender"" status and interest rate exportation could result in some of Upstarts loans being deemed void or unenforceable, in whole or in part.PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was ""Moodys Approach to Rating Consumer Loan-Backed ABS"" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/390487. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:UpMoodys could upgrade the notes if, given current expectations of portfolio losses, levels of credit enhancement are consistent with higher ratings. In sequential pay structures, such as the one in this transaction, credit enhancement grows as a percentage of the collateral balance as collections pay down senior notes. Moodys expectation of pool losses could decline as a result of better than expected improvements in the economy, changes to servicing practices that enhance collections or refinancing opportunities that result in prepayments. In addition, greater certainty concerning the legal and regulatory risks facing this transaction could lead to lower loss volatility assumptions, and thus lead to an upgrade of the notes.DownMoodys could downgrade the ratings of the notes if pool losses exceed its expectations and levels of credit enhancement are consistent with lower ratings. Credit enhancement could decline if excess spread is not sufficient to cover losses in a given month. Moodys expectation of pool losses may increase, for example, due to performance deterioration stemming from a downturn in the US economy, deficient servicing, errors on the part of transaction parties, inadequate transaction governance or fraud. In addition, the legal and regulatory risks stemming from the bank partner model that Upstart utilizes could expose the pool to increased losses.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

As a second step, Moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument.Moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.For ratings issued on a program, series, category/class of debt or security this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series, category/class of debt, security or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moodys rating practices.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-T-Mobile-to-Baa3-outlook-stable--PR_468077,Moody's upgrades T-Mobile to Baa3; outlook stable,"New York, July 20, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) upgraded T-Mobile USA, Inc.s (T-Mobile) senior unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Ba2 and affirmed the Baa3 rating on the companys existing senior secured notes and senior secured revolving credit facility. As a consequence of this rating action, Moodys fully expects T-Mobile will release all of the collateral underlying its existing senior secured notes through an Investment Grade Event Election option available to it under its secured bond indenture. This option will be able to be exercised once the company refinances its existing senior secured revolving credit facility with a replacement unsecured revolving credit facility or amends the existing facilitys collateral terms. Upon the effective exercise of the option and the resulting release of all underlying collateral, T-Mobiles existing senior secured debt obligations will become unsecured obligations and will then rank equal in priority with the companys Baa3-rated senior unsecured debt at both T-Mobile and its wholly-owned subsidiary Sprint LLC (Sprint). Moodys has also withdrawn T-Mobiles Ba1 corporate family rating, Ba1-PD probability of default rating and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. With this rating action, Moodys changed T-Mobiles ratings outlook to stable from positive.Upgrades:..Issuer: T-Mobile USA, Inc.....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to Baa3 from Ba2 (LGD4)..Issuer: Sprint Capital Corporation....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to Baa3 from Ba2 (LGD6)..Issuer: Sprint Communications LLC....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to Baa3 from Ba2 (LGD6)..Issuer: Sprint LLC....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to Baa3 from Ba2 (LGD6)Affirmations:..Issuer: T-Mobile USA, Inc.....Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility, Affirmed Baa3....Senior Secured Regular Bond/Debenture, Affirmed Baa3Withdrawals:..Issuer: T-Mobile USA, Inc.....

T-Mobiles sizable operating scale, high speed 5G coverage footprint, substantial upside growth potential in historically under-indexed rural and enterprise end market segments, solid incremental revenue growth adjacencies in fixed wireless access, extensive asset base and solid industry market position support continued subscriber growth, EBITDA margin expansion and ramping free cash flow over the next 12-18 months. The companys financial policy, which prudently focuses on network infrastructure investments to support market share growth, remains an important driver of the credit profile going forward. Moodys views network investments, including spectrum investments, as supportive of the business profile.T-Mobile is on track to realize around $5.3 billion of merger synergies by year-end 2022, and expects to achieve $7.5 billion of synergies by year-end 2024. The multi-year integration of the wireless network of Sprint into the legacy T-Mobile network has progressed far ahead of the target objectives set at the merger date in 2020. Synergies will exceed Moodys early expectations by over 25%, delivering high run rate cost efficiencies that will further bolster ramping free cash flow. Moodys expects the company will rapidly upgrade or decommission all legacy Sprint network tower sites by year-end 2022, with a meaningful pick-up in this activity beginning in the second half of 2022. The effort to migrate as many legacy Sprint customers as possible to T-Mobiles network, which includes guiding customers to optimal service and payment plan choices, will also accelerate in 2H 2022 from the around 40% of Sprint accounts which have migrated to date. Predominantly all of legacy Sprint customer traffic is now carried on the T-Mobile network. With over two years of solid network and operations integration completed, Moodys views the potential for execution missteps which could result in service quality deterioration and associated customer churn fallout as a low, remote and quickly abating risk. Since the merger, T-Mobile has continued to capture share in a saturated market due to its relentless focus on customer service, simple and innovative product offerings, competitive price plans and continual enhancements to its customer value proposition.Moodys expects that T-Mobiles debt leverage (Moodys adjusted) will fall to near 3.7x by year-end 2022 on a before merger related/Covid-19 costs basis, even after factoring in debt leverage impacts (Moodys adjusted) from potential future debt-funded spectrum investments. Moodys further expects T-Mobiles organic growth and continued progress on cost synergies will enable it to generate positive free cash flow in the mid-single digits as a percentage of revenue by year-end 2022, with ramping expansion thereafter. While T-Mobiles growing free cash flow can enable targeted share buybacks, Moodys expects such shareholder friendly actions will be prudent, measured and ultimately constrained by Board-enforced and company-defined debt targets. Moodys believes that T-Mobiles steadily improving cost structure will enable it to adequately invest in its network to remain competitive, including in future spectrum-based capacity enhancements and potential fiber investments if necessary to deliver evolving 5G technology applications while competing at discounted price points relative to its nationwide wireless peers. T-Mobiles increased operating scale now enables it to better pursue opportunities in several under-indexed markets, including in more rural and enterprise end markets. In addition, T-Mobile could benefit from its affiliation with its controlling shareholder Deutsche Telekom AG (DT, Baa1 stable), although Moodys does not impute any credit support to the rating from DT.Moodys expects that T-Mobile will maintain good liquidity over the next 12-18 months to address total cash needs including remaining debt maturities in 2022 and 2023. At March 31, 2022 T-Mobile had $3.2 billion of cash on hand and full availability under its $5.5 billion revolver. Moodys believes T-Mobiles remaining business and integration plan is adequately funded for aggregated costs to achieve synergies and effect full and final integration of networks and operations. For 2022, we expect the company to generate free cash flow (Moodys adjusted) of around $5.3 billion. Moodys free cash flow calculation is before spectrum investments, which we treat as a cash outflow within other investing activities on an industry basis and which can place some strain on overall liquidity when spectrum becomes broadly available in the industry. In 2023 we expect free cash flow to continue to ramp as the company realizes further merger synergies.T-Mobile also uses accounts receivable securitizations to manage the working capital swings associated with device financing plans. The company has a $950 million accounts receivable securitization facility and a $1.3 billion equipment installment plan. These facilities amortize over a short time frame and are a source of revolving credit. Moodys expects the company to extend and likely increase the size of these facilities as necessary, but if unsuccessful this could be a call on cash of up to around $2 billion.The companys commitments under its revolver maturing on April 1, 2025 include a first lien net leverage financial maintenance covenant of 3.3x, which the company was in compliance with as of March 31, 2022.Upon the release of all collateral underlying T-Mobile existing senior secured notes under the Investment Grade Event Election option, concurrent with the release of all collateral underlying T-Mobiles existing senior secured revolving credit facility, all formerly senior secured debt, with the exception of debt issued at Sprint Spectrum special purpose vehicles (SPVs), will become senior unsecured.For so long as the outstanding principal amount of the senior unsecured notes issued by T-Mobile in 2017 and 2018 exceeds $2.0 billion, (1) senior unsecured debt issued by T-Mobile (including any notes initially issued as senior secured notes) will continue to be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile US), parent of T-Mobile, and all wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of T-Mobile, including the entities acquired in the 2020 Sprint merger transaction (but SPVs will continue to be designated as restricted non-guarantors, and (2) T-Mobile US, T-Mobile and T-Mobiles wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) will also continue to guarantee Sprint spectrum lease payments on a senior unsecured basis. At such time as $2.0 billion or less of the senior unsecured notes issued by T-Mobile in 2017 and 2018 remain outstanding (and concurrent with the release of all subsidiary guarantees underlying T-Mobiles revolving credit facility), (1) all subsidiary guarantees of T-Mobiles senior unsecured debt may be released at T-Mobiles election, other than subsidiary guarantees of the senior unsecured notes issued by T-Mobile in 2017 and 2018, and (2) certain subsidiaries of Sprint Communications LLC (SC) will remain guarantors of the Sprint spectrum lease payments unless SC satisfies certain ratings and asset coverage conditions.At all times, the senior unsecured notes issued by Sprint and Sprints wholly-owned subsidiaries, SC and Sprint Capital Corporation (SCC), will continue to receive downstream senior unsecured guarantees from T-Mobile US and T-Mobile. Further, (1) the senior unsecured notes issued by Sprint will continue to be guaranteed by SC, (2) the senior unsecured notes issued by SC will continue to be guaranteed by Sprint and (3) the senior unsecured notes issued by SCC will continue to be guaranteed by both Sprint and SC.The stable outlook reflects Moodys expectation for T-Mobiles continued subscriber and service revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion, debt leverage (Moodys adjusted) declining steadily towards and sustained around 3.75x and rising free cash flow.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGST-Mobiles ratings could be upgraded if debt/EBITDA (Moodys adjusted) declines below 3.5x and free cash flow as a percentage of debt rises to the high-single digits, both on a sustained basis.The ratings could be downgraded if T-Mobiles debt/EBITDA (Moodys adjusted) was expected to be sustained above 4x, including as a result of additional debt-funded investments, or if free cash flow was to turn negative for an extended period of time.With headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) provides mobile communications services under the T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile brands in the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Following the merger of its parent, T-Mobile US, Inc., with Sprint on April 1, 2020, T-Mobile now operates with 109.5 million subscribers as of March 31, 2022. Deutsche Telekom AG owns an approximate 48.3% stake in T-Mobiles parent, T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile US), but consolidates the T-Mobile parent and subsidiaries by virtue of its voting control over approximately 51.8% of T-Mobile US.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Telecommunications Service Providers published in January 2017 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/48906.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-Traegers-outlook-to-negative-affirms-B3-CFR--PR_468742,Moody's changes Traeger's outlook to negative; affirms B3 CFR,"New York, August 16, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") affirmed TGP Holdings III LLCs (Traeger) ratings including its Corporate Family Rating (CFR) at B3, Probability of Default Rating (PDR) at B3-PD, and the B3 rating of the companys senior secured first lien credit facility. The first lien credit facility consists of a $125 million first lien revolver due 2026, a $510 million original amount first lien term loan due 2028, and a $50 million delayed draw first lien term loan due 2028. Moodys downgraded the companys Speculative Grade Liquidity rating to SGL-3 from SGL-2 and the outlook is negative.The negative outlook reflects Traegers very high financial leverage due to the companys continued deterioration of profitability and cash flows amid a challenging operating environment and weakening consumer demand. The company expects to report revenue for fiscal year 2022 of $640 - $660 million, a year-over-year decline of -16% to -18.5%. Traeger also expects its company-adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2022 at $35 - $45 million, or a year-over-year decline of -58% to -68%. The companys previous revenue and company-adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2022 was $800 - $850 million and $70 - $80 million, respectively. Traeger is experiencing significantly lower consumer demand for its grill products, particularly at price points below $1,000. As a result, Traeger reported a -25% sales decline in its grills segment for the second quarter of 2022 versus prior year. Ongoing inflationary pressures on consumer spending along with a shift in spending towards categories such as travel is negatively impacting retail traffic and demand for outdoor grills. In addition, high inventory levels of grills in the retail channel due to lower than expected sell through during the peak selling season is negatively impacting replenishment order activity. As a result of the meaningfully lower revenue and EBITDA expectations, Moodys projects Traegers credit metrics will materially deteriorate in fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023, with debt/EBITDA expected to increase to 15x.Given the lower revenue expectations Traeger implemented several cost savings initiatives, including workforce reduction and expense control. In addition, the company suspended operations of its Traeger Provisions business, which was unprofitable. The company expects to realize annualized cost savings of approximately $20 million from these initiatives. Traeger is also working to reduce its grill inventory levels both on hand and in the retail channel, and is materially lowering production volumes in its Asian manufacturing facilities and its suspending its plan for production in Mexico.Moodys expects the shift in consumer spending from goods to services and from discretionary to non-discretionary to persist into 2023 and make it difficult for the company to meaningfully improve operating performance. In addition, the lower consumer sentiment due to challenging macro-economic conditions could also pressure consumer demand at higher-price points, further reducing revenue and earnings.The downgrade of Traegers Speculative Grade Liquidity to SGL-3 reflects Moodys expectation for negative free cash flows in fiscal 2022 due to lower earnings and higher than normal inventory levels at year end 2022. The companys adequate liquidity is aided by the mostly undrawn $125 million first lien revolver due 2026, and the companys recent covenant amendment that increased the revolvers springing first lien net leverage financial maintenance covenant to 8.5x from 6.2x until the second quarter of 2023. The covenant amendment provides financial flexibility to utilize the revolver to fund anticipated working capital seasonality.The ratings affirmation reflects that Traegers earnings over the next 12 months are expected to remain at a level that covers its debt service requirements and sustains its capital structure, and that the companys adequate liquidity over the next 12 months provides time to improve operating results and cash flow generation. However, execution risks are heightened by Traegers high business and cash flow seasonality. Cost inflation or consumer demand trends could worsen during periods of high seasonality and increasing economic uncertainty.Affirmations:..Issuer: TGP Holdings III LLC....

Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating, Downgraded to SGL-3 from SGL-2Outlook Actions:..Issuer: TGP Holdings III LLC....Outlook, Changed To Negative From StableRATINGS RATIONALETraegers B3 CFR broadly reflects its very high financial leverage and Moodys expectations that debt/EBITDA will increase to over 15x by the end of fiscal 2022. The discretionary nature of outdoor grills and Traegers relatively expensive grills and accessories products, exposes the company to cyclical changes in consumer discretionary spending. High inflation and lower consumer sentiment is weakening consumer demand for outdoor grills and is materially and negatively impacting the companys profitability and cash flows. Moodys expects these pressures to persist into 2023. The company has modest relative scale with annual revenue under $800 million, and has narrow product focus, and limited geographic diversification. Traeger has high customer concentration and its cash flows are highly seasonal centered around the summer months.Traegers rating also reflects its solid market position within the niche wood pellet grill industry, and its strong brand image supported by its good track record of product innovation. The company benefits from the recurring nature of its sizable consumables segment that is more resilient to cyclical downturns, and its growing installed base. Traeger also benefits from its growing direct to consumer business and increased distribution in the grocery channel. The companys Speculative Grade Liquidity of SGL-3 reflects Moodys view that the company will maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12 months, supported by a mostly undrawn mostly undrawn $125 million revolving facility, which provides financial flexibility to fund seasonal investments in working capital.Traegers relies on raw materials primarily steel as part of the manufacturing process of its products. The company is exposed to the carbon transition and waste and pollution risks related to the energy intensive metal production, as well and transport, handling and disposal of its products. However, cost increases can generally be passed on to the consumers.Social risk factors reflect the companys exposure to challenges related to responsible production and supply chain management risks because the company sources its grills and accessories from suppliers primarily located in China and Vietnam. An extended supply chain disruption from situations such as the port backups or coronavirus would adversely affect the companys revenue and EBITDA. The company is also exposed to changes in consumer discretionary spending and changes in consumer trends such as food at-home and away-from home.Traeger is highly exposed to governance risks mainly driven by its concentrated ownership by private equity sponsors, and the companys financial strategy that includes operating with high leverage. Funds affiliated with AEA Investors, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board, and Trilantic Capital Partners maintain a controlling ownership interest in the company following the July 2021 initial public offering (IPO). Moodys expects financial policies to be somewhat less aggressive following the IPO including proceeds used to reduce debt, but leverage remains high given the companys reliance on cyclical discretionary consumer spending. Concentrated decision making under private equity control creates potential for event risk and decisions that favor shareholders over creditors.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe negative outlook reflects Traegers meaningful deterioration in profitability, cash flows, and credit metrics, and Moodys view that the capital structure could become unsustainable if the company is unable to improve profitability towards historical levels in fiscal 2023.The ratings could be upgraded if the company demonstrates consistent organic revenue growth along with EBITDA margin expansion towards historical levels, generates consistently good positive free cash flow with good levels of reinvestment, and sustains debt/EBITDA below 5.0x. A ratings upgrade would also require the company maintaining at least good liquidity and Moodys expectations of balanced financial policies that sustains credit metrics at the above levels.The ratings could be downgraded if the companys operating performance including the EBITDA margin does not improve, or free cash flow remains negative. The ratings could also be downgraded if liquidity deteriorates for any reason including limited availability on the revolver facility, or if the risk of an event of default increases.Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, TGP Holdings III LLC (Traeger) is a designer and distributor of wood pellet grills, grill accessories and related consumables. Traeger reported revenue of $760.9 million for the twelve month period ending 30 June 2022 and its largest market is North America (94% of fiscal 2021 sales). Following the July 2021 initial public offering (IPO) of Traeger, Inc., funds affiliated with AEA Investors, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board, and Trilantic Capital Partners maintain a controlling 64.5% interest in the company.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-the-outlook-on-Italy-to-negative-affirms-Baa3--PR_463267,Moody's changes the outlook on Italy to negative; affirms Baa3 ratings,"Paris, August 05, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today changed the outlook on the Government of Italy to negative from stable and affirmed the local- and foreign-currency long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings at Baa3. The senior unsecured foreign currency MTN program rating and foreign currency senior unsecured shelf ratings were affirmed at (P)Baa3, while the local currency Commercial Paper rating was affirmed at Prime-3 and the foreign currency Other Short-Term rating was affirmed at (P)Prime-3.While growth and fiscal developments delivered positive surprises in 2021 and early 2022, risks to Italys credit profile have been accumulating more recently because of the economic impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine (Caa3 negative) and domestic political developments, both of which could have material credit implications:1. Heightened risks that the political environment will impede the implementation of structural reforms, including those contained in Italys National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP);2. Increased risk that energy supply challenges will weaken economic prospects;3. Risks that Italys fiscal strength will be further weakened by sluggish growth, higher funding costs, and potentially weaker fiscal discipline.That said, the Baa3 ratings reflect Italys significant economic strengths, including its robust manufacturing sector, high household wealth, and the low indebtedness of the private sector. It also balances the strengths and challenges of Italian institutions. Finally, the rating reflects Moodys assumption that core euro area countries will support Italy in case of need, a view that has been confirmed by the European Central Banks (ECB) recent announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI).Italys local- and foreign-currency ceilings remain unchanged at Aa3. For euro-area countries, a six-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and the local currency rating as well as a zero-notch gap between the local-currency ceiling and foreign-currency ceiling is typical, reflecting benefits from the euro areas strong common institutional, legal and regulatory framework, as well as liquidity support and other crisis management mechanisms. It is also in line with Moodys view of de minimis exit risk from the euro area.Please click on this link https://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_ARFTL468478 for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral part of this Press Release and identifies each affected issuer.RATINGS RATIONALERATIONALE FOR THE NEGATIVE OUTLOOKFIRST DRIVER: HEIGHTENED RISKS THAT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WILL IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRUCTURAL REFORMSThe end of the Draghi government on 21 July and early elections on 25 September 2022 (brought forward from spring 2023) increase political and policy uncertainty against the backdrop of a challenging economic and market environment.The outgoing government had made significant progress in meeting in full and on time the milestones and targets contained in Italys NRRP, requesting two installments for a total of ?42 billion or 2.4% of GDP (on top of the pre-financing disbursed in August 2021 worth ?25 billion or 1.4% of GDP ). However, the early elections are likely to delay the achievement of some milestones and targets that were due by the end of 2022; these achievements are needed to unlock access to the next installment of NGEU funding, which totals ?19 billion (1.0% of GDP). There is also a material risk that the milestones and targets that are due in 2023 could also be delayed.Partial disbursements of NGEU funding are possible, but lower-than-expected disbursements would put downward pressure on investment spending at a time when high inflation and risks to energy supplies are already weighing on business and consumer confidence, as well as economic activity.Italy has strong incentives to comply with the terms of the NRRP because it only receives investment funds in exchange for reforms. Moreover, compliance with NRRP is also one of the preconditions for access to the ECBs TPI. While these incentives are clear, a future government may try to test the willingness of the European Commission and ECB to strictly enforce this conditionality. Given the incentive structures that are in place, though, failure to eventually follow through with reform commitments could be an indication of weakening legislative and executive institutions or weaker effectiveness of macroeconomic policymaking.SECOND DRIVER: INCREASED RISK THAT ENERGY SUPPLY CHALLENGES WILL WEAKEN ECONOMIC PROSPECTSSignificant reliance on gas for its energy exposes Italy to further cuts in supply from Russia as well as higher energy prices. Gas is mostly used for electricity generation and by households, with industry representing a smaller share than is the case in some other gas-dependent European sovereigns. The outgoing government had taken a number of measures to reduce gas consumption and diversify supplies, having stated that Italys reliance on Russia had been cut to around 25% from 40% of total imports.Having said this, Italy is better positioned than other vulnerable European countries such as Germany (Aaa stable), thanks to its LNG terminals and pipeline linkages to North Africa, Northern Europe and Central Asia, which allow Italy to use alternative gas supply sources without new infrastructure, though capacity of existing infrastructure does not allow a total replacement of Russian gas supplies. The government has made significant efforts to diversify gas supplies through deals with African and Middle Eastern countries, though some of this additional supply will take time to become available. Italy also has domestic gas production and renewable energy potential that could be increased in the coming years.Although the lower reliance of Italys industry on gas reduces the economic risks of the disruption, the use for electricity generation and by households will result in higher domestic energy prices, fueling inflation and causing a significant confidence shock. Efforts to mitigate the economic impact on households could also have a fiscal impact, though to-date support measures have not caused a deviation from fiscal targets because of higher-than-expected government revenues. There could also be second-round effects from Italys reliance on gas for electricity generation. While some measures have been taken such as a cap on heating and air conditioning as well as a restart of coal-fired power plants, gas accounts for almost 50% of electricity supply and the impact would be felt through the wider economy.THIRD DRIVER: RISKS THAT ITALYS FISCAL STRENGTH WILL BE FURTHER WEAKENED BY SLUGGISH GROWTH, HIGHER FUNDING COSTS AND WEAKER FISCAL DISCIPLINEUnder Moodys current baseline scenario, debt will continue to decline in 2022 owing to strong nominal growth and a reduction in the deficit. Moodys forecasts debt-to-GDP to stand at 145% down from 151% in 2021 but about 11 percentage points higher than before the pandemic. Debt will decline further in 2023 and stabilise below 143% of GDP thereafter, due to slowing nominal growth and higher interest payments.A positive differential between nominal growth and interest rates is key to Moodys baseline and the debt trajectory is vulnerable to shocks. Significantly weaker economic growth or a more rapid increase in Italys borrowing costs would likely challenge debt sustainability if, as Moodys expects, Italy continues to run primary deficits until at least 2024.As outlined above, there are material risks to growth prospects due to uncertainties regarding the execution of Italys NRRP and risks to energy supplies. Moreover, funding costs have been rising since the start of 2022 after the ECB signaled it would end the pandemic asset purchase programme in July 2022 and hike rates; funding costs rose further following recent political developments.The increase in funding costs will start to reverse the improvements in debt affordability recorded over the last decade although interest costs will remain lower than a decade ago. Higher interest rates will be relatively slow to feed through to higher interest payments given Italys reasonably long debt maturity of 7.1 years as at end-July 2022. So far, Italy continues to issue below the average cost of its debt, which means it continues to refinance maturing debt at lower rates: as of June 2022, the average cost of debt at issuance was 140-150 basis points lower than the average cost of debt although the difference has been falling.That said, debt affordability metrics will start deteriorating as soon as this year because Italy has just over 11% of the central government debt that is inflation-linked and a further 11% that is floating rate. According to the Italian fiscal council, every 1 percentage point increase in inflation adds ?1.8 billion (0.1% of GDP) in interest costs while a 100-bps upward shift in the yield curve adds ?2.5 billion in the first year (0.1% of GDP). In Moodys base case, debt affordability will deteriorate gradually through the forecast period, with interest costs reaching a still-manageable 8.1% of revenue by 2025.The return of political uncertainty and a failure to meet NRRP targets would leave Italy more exposed to investor confidence at a time when the government needs investors to play an increased role in the Italian debt market amid ECB monetary policy normalisation. Moodys does not expect the recently announced TPI will be a panacea against rising yields in all circumstances. While the ECBs Governing Council has a lot of discretion over the activation of the tool, its aim is to counter a deterioration in financing conditions that is not warranted by country-specific fundamentals. In other words, the ECB will be less likely to activate the tool quickly if the rise in yields is triggered by domestic policy choices.Signs that the next government was implementing policies that resulted in structurally higher fiscal deficits would also put debt on an upward trajectory. Some parties are advocating for tax cuts and social benefit hikes that would be politically difficult to reverse. A more expansionary fiscal policy than outlined in the previous governments medium-term fiscal plan would likely result in higher debt.RATIONALE FOR THE Baa3 RATINGThe Baa3 ratings reflect Italys large, very diversified and competitive manufacturing sector, which has shown its capacity to rebound swiftly. High household wealth levels and the low indebtedness of the private sector provide a cushion in the current inflationary shock. Institutions are strong compared to rating peers although there are lingering weaknesses in the countrys administrative capacity and the control of corruption.Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro area and its bond market is the largest in the monetary union. The significant exposure of systemic institutions to Italy makes core European economies susceptible to the potential emergence of stress in the Italian government debt market. Italys systemic importance to the euro area therefore represents a strong case for support by core European countries if needed, a view that has been confirmed by the ECBs recent announcements of TPI.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSItalys ESG Credit Impact Score is moderately negative (CIS-3), reflecting a combination of moderate exposure to environmental risks, high exposure to social risks and, like many other advanced economies, very strong governance and in general strong capacity to respond to shocks.Italys E issuer profile score is moderately negative (E-3). Italy has low exposure to environmental risks across most categories, though the country has a moderate exposure to physical climate risk, in particular water and heat stress as well as wildfires. Italy is among the most exposed to heat stress in Southern Europe according to Moodys climate risk data. Agriculture, though a relatively small share of GDP and employment, is located in regions that are at higher risk of drought around the Po River and in the South. Although it generates a relatively small share of electricity supply (20%), hydropower is the second largest source of energy generation and is affected by recurring droughts.Moodys assesses Italys S issuer profile score as highly negative (S-4), mainly due to high demographic risks as well as risks related to labour and income. Italy has one of the oldest populations already now and public social spending is heavily geared towards pensions. Labour force participation rates are low for an advanced economy, in particular for women, and regional divergences in unemployment are profound, reflecting at least in part ineffective labour market institutions. Successive governments have implemented pension reforms over the past, which provides an important mitigating factor for the rapid ageing of the population, though health care spending and long-term care spending are still set to rise in the coming decades. Exposure to other social risks such as housing, health and safety issues and access to basic services is low.Italys very high institutions and governance strength is reflected in a positive G issuer profile score (G-1). In a global comparison, Italy scores well on global surveys assessing voice & accountability, regulatory quality and government effectiveness. Italy scores somewhat weaker on control of corruption and rule of law than other European countries, but in line with other similarly rated sovereigns. Fiscal transparency and planning is good, with Italy benefitting from European fiscal rules and the credibility of the European Central Bank.The publication of this rating action deviates from the previously scheduled release dates in the EU sovereign calendar published on www.moodys.com. This action was prompted by heightened policy uncertainty following the governments collapse in July, which comes against the backdrop of a much more challenging economic and market environment.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 46,161 (2021) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): 6.6% (2021) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 4.2% (2021)Gen.

The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuers economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have not materially changed. The issuers institutions and governance strength, have not materially changed. The issuers fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has not materially changed. The issuers susceptibility to event risks has not materially changed.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSWHAT COULD MOVE THE RATINGS UPAlthough a rating upgrade is unlikely in the near future, Moodys would consider changing the outlook to stable if Italian institutions, growth prospects and the debt trajectory proved resilient to downside risks stemming from political uncertainty, risks to energy security and rising borrowing costs. Evidence that the next government is committed to the implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms, including those outlined in the countrys NRRP, would likely lead to a stabilisation of the outlook if this was accompanied by a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan that would prevent debt from significantly rising.WHAT COULD MOVE THE RATINGS DOWNMoodys would likely downgrade Italys ratings if it were to anticipate a significant weakening of the countrys medium-term growth prospects, possibly due to failure to implement growth-enhancing reforms, including those outlined in the countrys NRRP. Signs that the debt was likely to start significantly trending upwards, either as a result of materially weaker growth prospects, a spike in interest costs or material fiscal loosening, would be negative for the ratings. Fiscal and/or economic policies that weakened market sentiment and caused debt levels to rise over the medium term would also lead to downward rating pressure.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/63168.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Strathcona-Resources-B2-CFR-outlook-still-positive-following--PR_468330,Moody's affirms Strathcona Resources' B2 CFR; outlook still positive following acquisition,"Toronto, July 29, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) has affirmed all of Strathcona Resources Ltd.s (Strathcona) ratings, including its B2 corporate family rating (CFR), its B2-PD probability of default rating, and the B3 rating on its senior unsecured notes. The outlook remains positive.On July 27, 2022, Strathcona entered into an agreement with Serafina Energy Ltd. (Serafina) to acquire all the outstanding shares of Serafina for cash consideration of C$2.3 billion. A payment of C$1.9 billion will be made at closing on August 29, 2022, and deferred payments of C$100 million will be made on each of September 30, 2022, October 31, 2022, November 30, 2022 and December 30, 2022. The acquisition will be funded through borrowings on Strathconas revolving credit facility, with total committed borrowing capacity increased to C$2 billion (from C$1.5 billion), and through a C$700 million term loan. Serafina is an exploration and production company that produces about 40,000 bbls/d (before royalties) primarily through thermal heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan.""The affirmation and maintenance of the positive outlook reflects Strathconas sizable production and reserve base pro forma for the complimentary Serafina acquisition,"" said Moodys analyst Paresh Chari. ""The affirmation also reflects that financial leverage will remain solid despite the acquisition being entirely debt funded because Strathcona will use free cash flow to reduce debt.""Affirmations:..Issuer: Strathcona Resources Ltd..... Corporate Family Rating, Affirmed B2.... Probability of Default Rating, Affirmed B2-PD....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Affirmed B3 (LGD5)Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Strathcona Resources Ltd.....Outlook, Remains PositiveRATINGS RATIONALEStrathconas rating benefits from: 1) good credit metrics that should improve over the next 12-18 months with the company using free cash flow to reduce debt and improve retained cash flow to debt towards 50% in 2023; 2) majority of production from heavy oil and oil sands assets that have low decline rates (around 20%) that requires a low level of capital to sustain production; and 3) a sizable production (about 150,000 boe/d) and proved developed reserve (175 million boe) base pro forma for the acquisition. The companys rating is constrained by: 1) its limited operating history and rapid growth through acquisitions, which leads to greater financial and operating uncertainty as well as execution risks associated with the companys plan to grow production organically; 2) its exposure to heavy oil that is benchmarked to the historically volatile Western Canadian heavy oil price; and 3) an aggressive funding for the acquisition that utilizes a high proportion of committed credit capacity and an 18 month term loan that limits Strathconas financial flexibility.Strathconas liquidity is significantly diminished by the acquisition, but is adequate. Proforma for the Serafina acquisition and new debt instruments, Moodys expects minimal cash and about C$200 million of availability under its C$2 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in February 2026). Moodys expects about $450 million of free cash flow through to mid-2023 using Moodys medium term price assumptions and much higher if current market prices were to persist. Strathcona will also need to fund the deferred payments of C$400 million from September to December 2022 which Moodys expects will be funded using revolver availability and free cash flow. Strathconas new term loan is subject to a cash flow sweep provision that sweeps 100% of free cash flow until the term loan balance falls by 50%, and then the cash flow sweep declines to 50%. Moodys expects Strathcona will be in compliance with its three financial covenants through to mid-2023. Alternate liquidity is limited, as all assets are pledged to the first lien credit facilities, but only 50% of the asset sale proceeds are required to repay the term loan.Strathconas unsecured notes are rated B3, one notch below the companys B2 CFR. Moodys Loss Given Default for Speculative-Grade Companies (LGD) methodology suggests that the notes be ranked two notches below Strathconas B2 CFR due to the size and priority ranking of the companys C$2 billion first lien revolver and C$700 million first lien term loan due 2024 (revolver and term loan are pari passu) relative to the unsecured US$500 million notes due 2026 in the companys capital structure. However, given the positive outlook on Strathconas CFR, strong asset coverage, Moodys views the assigned B3 rating as more appropriate. If the CFR is upgraded to B1, then the notes rating is likely to remain B3 absent unanticipated changes to the capital structure. However, if the CFR remains B2 and the outlook changed to stable, the notes rating is likely to be downgraded.The positive outlook is supported by Moodys expectation that Strathconas credit metrics and liquidity will improve with debt reduction funded by free cash flow and that production will modestly grow over the next 12 to 18 months.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe ratings could be upgraded if Strathcona is able successfully operate the acquired assets, organically grow production at competitive costs while maintaining positive free cash flow, if retained cash flow (RCF)-to-debt is sustained above 30%, and the LFCR is sustained above 1.5x.The ratings could be downgraded if RCF-to-debt is below 15%, if the LFCR is below 1x, or Strathconas liquidity profile deteriorates either as a result of sustained negative free cash flow or from cash distributions to the companys PE owners.Strathcona Resources Ltd. is an oil and gas producer headquartered in Calgary Alberta, with producing assets located across Western Canada. Strathcona is majority owned by private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Independent Exploration and Production published in August 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/74836.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-provisional-ratings-to-Upstart-Securitization-Trust-2022-4--PR_468188,Moody's assigns provisional ratings to Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4,"Approximately $179 million of asset-backed securities ratedNew York, August 10, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has assigned provisional ratings to the notes to be issued by Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4 (""UPST 2022-4""), the fourth personal loan securitization issued from the UPST shelf this year. The collateral backing UPST 2022-4 consists of unsecured consumer installment loans originated by Cross River Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank and FinWise Bank, a Utah state-chartered commercial bank, all utilizing the Upstart Program, respectively. Upstart Network, Inc. (""Upstart"") will act as the servicer of the loans.The complete rating actions are as follows:Issuer: Upstart Securitization Trust 2022-4Class A Notes, Assigned (P)A3 (sf)Class B Notes, Assigned (P)Ba2 (sf)RATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings are based on the quality of the underlying collateral and its expected performance, the strength of the capital structure and fast amortization of the assets, the experience and expertise of Upstart as servicer, and the back-up servicing arrangement with Wilmington Trust, National Association (""Wilmington"") and its designated sub-agent, Systems & Services Technologies, Inc. (S&ST unrated).Moodys median cumulative net loss expectation for the 2022-4 pool is 16.9% and the stress loss is 58.0%. Moodys based its cumulative net loss expectation on an analysis of the credit quality of the underlying collateral; the historical performance of similar collateral, including securitization performance and managed portfolio performance; the ability of Upstart to perform its servicing functions; the ability of Wilmington and its sub-agent to perform the backup servicing functions; and current expectations for the macroeconomic environment during the life of the transaction.At closing, the Class A and Class B notes are expected to benefit from 32.5% and 20.5% of hard credit enhancement respectively. Hard credit enhancement for the notes consists of a combination of overcollateralization, a non-declining reserve account and subordination for the Class A notes. The notes may also benefit from excess spread.The social risk for this transaction is high. Marketplace lenders have attracted elevated levels of regulatory attention at the state and federal level. As such, regulatory and borrower challenges to marketplace lenders and their third-party lending partners over ""true lender"" status and interest rate exportation could result in some of Upstarts loans being deemed void or unenforceable, in whole or in part.PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was ""Moodys Approach to Rating Consumer Loan-Backed ABS"" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/390487. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:UpMoodys could upgrade the notes if, given current expectations of portfolio losses, levels of credit enhancement are consistent with higher ratings. In sequential pay structures, such as the one in this transaction, credit enhancement grows as a percentage of the collateral balance as collections pay down senior notes. Moodys expectation of pool losses could decline as a result of better than expected improvements in the economy, changes to servicing practices that enhance collections or refinancing opportunities that result in prepayments. In addition, greater certainty concerning the legal and regulatory risks facing this transaction could lead to lower loss volatility assumptions, and thus lead to an upgrade of the notes.DownMoodys could downgrade the ratings of the notes if pool losses exceed its expectations and levels of credit enhancement are consistent with lower ratings. Credit enhancement could decline if excess spread is not sufficient to cover losses in a given month. Moodys expectation of pool losses may increase, for example, due to performance deterioration stemming from a downturn in the US economy, deficient servicing, errors on the part of transaction parties, inadequate transaction governance or fraud. In addition, the legal and regulatory risks stemming from the bank partner model that Upstart utilizes could expose the pool to increased losses.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form. Moodys Rating Symbols and Definitions can be found on https://ratings.moodys.com/rating-definitions.Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on https://ratings.moodys.com/documents/PBS_1337175.The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a second step, Moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument.Moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.For ratings issued on a program, series, category/class of debt or security this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series, category/class of debt, security or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moodys rating practices.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Paraguays-Ba1-ratings-changes-outlook-to-positive-from--PR_467030,Moody's affirms Paraguay's Ba1 ratings; changes outlook to positive from stable,"New York, July 22, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today affirmed the Government of Paraguays long-term Ba1 issuer ratings and senior unsecured bond ratings and changed the outlook to positive from stable.The key drivers for the positive outlook are:1. A track-record of solid growth and prudent fiscal policy are supporting Paraguays positive credit momentum; fiscal and debt metrics compare favorably with those of Baa-rated sovereigns2. Structural and fiscal reforms will support institutional strength and governanceOver the past decade, successive governments have maintained strong commitment to fiscal discipline, despite several economic shocks, leading to a solid fiscal position and strong average GDP growth.. Moodys expects Paraguay to maintain its prudent fiscal policy stance, ensuring the debt burden remains moderate, with structural reforms supporting medium-term fiscal prospects and reinforcing Paraguays institutional frameworks. Approval and implementation of fiscal and structural reforms will improve the sovereigns credit profile, including reforms related to the public procurement system, civil service reform and strengthening Paraguays anti-money laundering framework, as well as reforms to the public pension fund. These reforms would enhance the efficiency of public spending and create fiscal space for expenditures related to infrastructure and building human capital.Paraguays country ceilings remain unchanged. The local-currency country ceiling is positioned three notches above the sovereign rating at Baa1, reflecting the economys economic fundamentals, limited government intervention in the economy and moderately strong institutional framework. The foreign-currency country ceiling is Baa2, supported by a strong external position, floating exchange rate and an open capital account, which all reduce convertibility risks.RATINGS RATIONALEA TRACK-RECORD OF SOLID GROWTH AND PRUDENT FISCAL POLICY SUPPORT PARAGUAYS POSITIVE CREDIT MOMENTUM; FISCAL AND DEBT METRICS COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH THOSE OF Baa-RATED SOVEREIGNSParaguays economic performance has been robust for more than a decade. GDP grew in real terms at an average annual rate of 4.1% in 2010-19, exceeding the corresponding median for both Ba and Baa-rated sovereigns. Ongoing public infrastructure investment will support growth in the coming years and large FDI inflows will contribute to diversify the economy.After an economic contraction of 1% in 2022, Moodys expects strong real GDP growth of 5% in 2023 on the back of a rebound in the agricultural sector. Over the medium term, investment in infrastructure and renewable energy, as well as strong FDI investment will sustain GDP growth at around 4% annually. Moodys expects investment in a pulp mill project to materially increase FDI inflows over the next 2-3 years and projects they will rise to 4% of GDP from 1.2% in 2022.Paraguay adhered to its fiscal rule, which allowed fiscal deficits of up to 1.5% of GDP between 2010 and 2019. After the deficit reached 6.2% of GDP in 2020 due to the pandemic, the authorities reiterated their commitment to returning to the 1.5% of GDP deficit target by 2024. In 2021, the government deficit was cut nearly in half to 3.8% of GDP and the government took steps to ensure convergence to the target by 2024. Moodys expects this fiscal path will allow the sovereign to rebuild fiscal space lost during the pandemic shock. Under the terms defined by the fiscal rule (i.e., 1.5% of GDP deficit target), Paraguays debt ratio will stabilize at 38% of GDP in 2023 and gradually begin to decline thereafter.Paraguays fiscal and debt metrics compare favorably with Baa-rated peers. Moodys expects debt-to-GDP to remain below the median for both Ba and Baa-rated sovereigns. Even though debt affordability as measured by the interest-to-revenue ratio has increased moderately over time, Moodys projects it will remain below the Ba median and in line with the Baa median.STRUCTURAL AND FISCAL REFORMS WILL SUPPORT INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND GOVERNANCEThe government has presented several laws to congress to address the countrys institutional shortcomings. The proposals include structural reforms to the civil service, social security system, public procurement system, as well as an enhanced fiscal responsibility law. Congress has approved reforms to Paraguays Development Bank (Agencia Financiera de Desarrollo) that will allow the entity to better support PPP infrastructure projects.The proposed civil service reform aims to regulate and control spending on public sector wages and to improve the overall efficiency of the public sector. On the pension front, the reform will create a supervisory body to regulate eight existing pension funds for public sector workers as well as the private sector pension scheme (Instituto Provision Social IPS).Reforms to the pension system would help reduce informality and improve the social safety net. Increasing formalization of the labor force would help expand the tax base.The new public procurement law would help reduce costs of government purchase of goods and services while simultaneously increasing the efficiency and transparency of the process.Changes to the fiscal responsibility law will outline criteria to ensure deficit converges to the target in the event of large deviations driven by economic contractions or external shocks, put a cap on government debt as a percentage of GDP, and limit the growth in current expenditure in real terms to create the fiscal space for infrastructure investment and social spending on health and education spending . Moodys expects that, if approved, these changes will lay the foundations required to ensure the 1.5% deficit ceiling is met and will allow for convergence with the ceiling over a 2-3 year transition period in the event of severe shocks, enhancing the credibility of the fiscal framework.ESG considerationsParaguays ESG Credit Impact Score is moderately negative (CIS-3), reflecting a relatively weak governance profile, despite broadly effective macroeconomic and fiscal policies, moderately negative social risks due to inadequate access to basic services, and moderately negative exposure to environmental risks.Paraguays exposure to environmental risks is moderately negative (E-3 issuer profile score), reflecting the risk of droughts and flooding to agricultural and hydroelectric generation, balanced against Paraguays position as a producer and exporter of clean energy and its limited reliance on hydrocarbons.Paraguays exposure to social risks is moderately negative (S-3 issuer profile score), balancing positive demographic trends with relatively weak educational outcomes that limit Paraguays competitiveness.The influence of governance on Paraguays credit profile is moderately negative (G-3 issuer profile score), balancing the impact of relatively weak, but improving, governance indicators related to corruption and rule of law against a track record of sound macroeconomic policies and strong fiscal metrics.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 13,722 (2021) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): 4.2% (2021) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 6.8% (2021)Gen.

The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuers economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have not materially changed. The issuers institutions and governance strength, have materially increased. The issuers fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has not materially changed. An analysis of this issuer, relative to its peers, indicates that a repositioning of its rating would be appropriate.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe rating would be upgraded if structural reforms related to the civil service, public pension fund and public procurement were approved and implemented. These reforms would enhance the countrys institutional and governance framework, improving Paraguays overall credit profile. Changes to the fiscal rule, which would increase policy predictability in response to shocks, and the materialization of robust investment and FDI inflows would also contribute to a higher rating.The outlook could change back to stable if implementation of the structural reform agenda does not advance at a steady pace or if economic growth prospects come below Moodys expectations, leading to an upward trend in debt metrics.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/63168.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-outlook-to-negative-from-stable-on-6-Czech--PR_468237,Moody's changes outlook to negative from stable on 6 Czech sub-sovereigns; ratings affirmed,"Frankfurt am Main, August 10, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today changed the outlook on 6 Czech sub-sovereign entities to negative from stable. Concurrently, Moodys has affirmed their long-term issuer ratings. The Baseline Credit Assessments (BCA) on all 6 Czech sub-sovereigns have also been affirmed.Todays rating actions follow Moodys decision on 5 August 2022 to change the outlook of the Government of the Czech Republic to negative from stable and affirm its Aa3 rating. The increased risk of the materialization of prolonged, severe gas supply disruptions from Russia could lead to rationing and push the countrys economy in a deep recession with negative implications for trend growth and a material weakening of fiscal metrics. For full details, please refer to the sovereign press release at: https://www.moodys.com/research/--PR_467883.Specifically, Moodys has affirmed the Aa3 long-term issuer ratings for City of Prague, City of Brno and City of Ostrava and changed their outlooks to negative from stable. Their BCAs have been affirmed at aa3. For the City of Prague, the Aa3 senior unsecured debt rating has also been affirmed.At the same time, Moodys has affirmed the A1 long-term issuer ratings for South-Moravian Region, Moravian-Silesian Region and Region of Liberec. Their BCAs were also affirmed at a1. The national rating scale issuer ratings of the South-Moravian Region and the Region of Liberec have been affirmed at Aa2.cz. The outlook for the three regions has been changed to negative from stable.RATINGS RATIONALERATIONALE FOR THE OUTLOOK CHANGE TO NEGATIVE FROM STABLEThe outlook change to negative from stable for the six Czech sub-sovereign entities mirrors a similar change to the sovereign government bond rating. The vast majority of the Czech regional and local governments (RLG) revenue comes from government transfers and shared taxes  namely, personal income tax, corporate tax and value added tax  over which Czech RLGs have no flexibility and which mainly reflect the strength of the national economy. Therefore any economic shock at the national level would affect the pool of revenue available to the RLG sector. It would likely lead to a deterioration in the Czech regions fiscal position given their fairly rigid budget structure, which reflects the importance of health and social care responsibilities in their budgets. In contrast, Czech cities have more leeway to adjust their expenditure to a revenue shock but their ratings, currently on par with the Sovereign, are capped by it. While all Czech cities exhibit very robust financials, they do not have sufficient financial flexibility to justify a rating above that of the Sovereign. The central government retains control of Czech RLGs via legislation, adjustments to level of transfers, and the management of pay-raise packages for civil servants.RATINGS RATIONALE FOR THE RATINGS AFFIRMATIONThe BCA and rating affirmations at aa3/Aa3 for the cities of Prague, Brno and Ostrava reflect Moodys view that these cities will maintain strong operating performances. According to Moodys baseline forecast their gross operating balances in 2022-23 would represent, respectively, 19 % of operating revenue for City of Ostrava and 23% in the case of Brno and Prague. While City of Prague will decrease its debt level to 7% of operating revenue by 2024, Moodys forecasts debt levels to slightly increase for Brno and Ostrava due to their higher capital expenditure (to 27% of operating revenue and 26% of operating revenue, respectively). In case of an economic shock all cities would benefit from their very strong liquidity positions, which currently fully covers their direct and indirect debt.The BCA and rating affirmations at a1/A1 for the South-Moravian Region, Moravian-Silesian Region and Region of Liberec reflect their stable operating performance. Their debt levels declined in the past years, ranging from 8% of operating revenue (South-Moravian Region) to 2% of operating revenue (Liberec Region) at year-end 2021. In Moodys baseline forecasts, debt levels for these three Czech regions should remain below 10% of operating revenue in next two years. Their liquidity position remains stable and fully covers the debt levels at year-end 2021.Both regions and cities have a strong governance profile. They use prudent financial planning providing them the ability to identify potential pressures or to adjust plans accordingly to mitigate credit pressure. Fiscal and debt policies are prudent and transparent, and their liquidity management is conservative.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSThe City of Pragues and City of Brnos ESG Credit Impact Score is neutral-to-low (CIS-2), reflecting low exposure to environmental risks, mostly low exposure to social risks and, very strong governance and in general strong capacity to respond to shocks.The City of Ostravas ESG Credit Impact Score is neutral-to-low (CIS-2), reflecting moderately negative exposure to environmental risks, mostly low exposure to social risks, along with very strong governance and policy effectiveness that mitigate the citys susceptibility to these risks.The South-Moravian Regions ESG Credit Impact Score neutral-to-low (CIS-2), reflecting moderately negative exposure to environmental risks, mostly low exposure to social risks and solid institutions and governance strength.The Moravian-Silesian Regions ESG Credit Impact Score neutral-to-low (CIS-2), reflecting moderately negative exposure to environmental and social risks, along with solid institutions and governance strength.The Region of Liberecs ESG Credit Impact Score neutral-to-low (CIS-2), reflecting moderately negative exposure to social risks, low exposure to environmental risks along with solid institutions and governance strength.Prague, Brno and the Region of Liberec have an environmental issuer profile score of E-2 (neutral-to-low); Moravian-Silesian Region, South-Moravian Region and Ostrava have E-3 (moderately negative). The Moravian-Silesian Region and the capital of this region Ostrava have moderately negative exposure to physical climate risk stemmed from its industrial history. The South-Moravian Region is exposed to drought with negative impact on the wine industry in the region.While all cities and the South-Moravian Region have a social issuer profile score S-2 (neutral-to-low), the Moravian-Silesian and the Region of Liberec have a score S-3 (moderately negative) which is driven by the challenges in demographics (mainly ageing of population), labor and income risks and access to basic services. All cities benefit from the status of the regions capital city with good access to education, healthcare facilities and access to basic services but also worse housing affordability compared to other (rather smaller) cities. Ostrava is moderately negatively exposed to the decline in population as the result of de-industrialization of the city and the whole region.In terms of their governance issuer profile scores, all cities achieve the highest score G-1 (positive) while all regions G-2 (neutral to low). Czech Republic is characterized by overall strong institutional and governance framework. Cities utilize prudent financing planning which allows for multi-year forecasting of key trends. Regions historically post good governance practices, especially in terms of transparency and disclosure, policy credibility and budgetary management.The sovereign action required the publication of these credit rating actions on a date that deviates from the previously scheduled release date in the sovereign release calendar, published on https://ratings.moodys.com.ECONOMIC INDICATORS SOVEREIGN LEVELThe specific economic indicators, as required by EU regulation, are not available for Prague, City of, Brno, City of, Ostrava, City of, South-Moravian Region, Moravian-Silesian, Region of and Liberec, Region of.

The main points raised during the discussion were: the systemic risk in which the issuers operate has materially increased.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSAn upgrade of the Czech sub-sovereigns ratings is not likely given the negative outlook. For regions rated below the sovereign rating level, evidence of a given entitys ability to display comparatively stronger credit fundamentals could exert upward rating pressure.A downgrade of the regional governments ratings could result from a weakening of the sovereigns credit profile or significant weakening of their individual financials metrics.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Regional and Local Governments published in January 2018 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/66129. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.The weighting of all rating factors is described in the methodology used in this credit rating action, if applicable.Moodys National Scale Credit Ratings (NSRs) are intended as relative measures of creditworthiness among debt issues and issuers within a country, enabling market participants to better differentiate relative risks. NSRs differ from Moodys global scale credit ratings in that they are not globally comparable with the full universe of Moodys rated entities, but only with NSRs for other rated debt issues and issuers within the same country. NSRs are designated by a "".nn"" country modifier signifying the relevant country, as in "".za"" for South Africa. For further information on Moodys approach to national scale credit ratings, please refer to Moodys Credit rating Methodology published in August 2022 entitled ""Mapping National Scale Ratings from Global Scale Ratings Methodology"". While NSRs have no inherent absolute meaning in terms of default risk or expected loss, a historical probability of default consistent with a given NSR can be inferred from the GSR to which it maps back at that particular point in time.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-Ba3-rating-to-Pikes-300-million-incremental-first--PR_468555,Moody's assigns Ba3 rating to Pike's $300 million incremental first-lien term loan,"New York, August 08, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has assigned a Ba3 rating to the $300 million first-lien term loan to be issued by Pike Corporation (""Pike""). Pike plans to use the term loan proceeds to fund an acquisition and to repay a $75 million bridge loan it borrowed to partially fund the redemption of Lindsay Goldbergs equity stake in Pikes parent company.The issuance of an additional $300 million debt to fund the acquisition and equity redemption is credit negative, as it will increase Pikes debt leverage and reduce its financial buffer against unexpected cost overruns from electric construction and engineering projects. The company has been pursuing aggressive financial policy, which elevates the risk of a rating decline if business integration or project execution goes against plan. This incremental debt issuance will likely exhaust the existing headroom for the Pikes B2 Corporate Family Rating (""CFR"") with a stable outlook.The Ba3 rating on the incremental first-lien term loan reflects its first priority lien on the assets of Pike and its seniority relative to the unsecured notes.The ratings are subject to the transaction closing as proposed and receipt and review of the final documentation.The following ratings/assessments are affected by todays action:New Assignments:..Issuer: Pike Corporation....GTD Senior Secured 1st Lien Term Loan, Assigned Ba3 (LGD3)RATINGS RATIONALEMoodys expects the incremental debt issuance will result in limited headroom for Pikes B2 Corporate Family Rating, which requires debt leverage below 5.5x. Pikes gross debt will increase to $1.8 billion, including $1 billion first-lien term loan (incl. $300 million incremental issuance) due January 2028 and $725 million senior unsecured notes due September 2028. Pro-forma debt leverage, including the incremental debt and Moodys adjustment for operating lease, will increase to low-five times versus 4.7x at the end of March 2022.Business execution risks are increasing with recent acquisitions. The current acquisition target is a service provider of vegetation management to electric transmission and distribution utilities in the Southern and Midwestern US. Although the acquisition targets business profile is complementary and helps expand Pikes service offerings, it remains to be seen whether the acquisition target can sustain its strong earnings once integrated into Pike. The integration of the acquired Entregado in early 2022 is still ongoing. Entregado had weak operating performance prior to Pikes acquisition from undertaking lump-sum contracts over the last three years; however, such lump-sum contracts have been completed. Pike is working towards significant earnings improvement from cost synergies, including more favorable lease agreements and back office consolidation.Management has become more aggressive in financial policy. This elevates the risk of a rating decline, if cost overruns or quality issues cause earnings or cash flows to fall below expectation. The company has embarked on more frequent and sizable shareholder distributions, including $125 million in January 2022, $100 million in April 2021 and $60 million in August 2020. The recent change in ownership structure resulted from an equity redemption partially funded by a $75 million bridge loan. Additionally, we expect Pike will continue to pay dividends to its parent holding company that issued preferred stock to partially facilitate the equity redemption of Lindsay Goldberg.Moodys expects the new ownership structure will not change the companys business strategy or financial policy. Governance risks remain high due to the concentrated voting rights by the founder, leveraged capital structure, frequent shareholder distributions, debt-funded acquisitions and related party transactions. Eric Pike, the Companys chairman and CEO, has gained the majority voting rights in the company and Lindsay Goldberg has become a minority shareholder with a 22% equity stake (down from 50.1%).Fundamentally, Pikes credit profile is constrained by its limited geographic and end market diversity since it mostly provides engineering, maintenance, repair, replacement, and upgrade work for electric utilities. It also incorporates its customer concentration, moderate scale and the competitive nature of the utility and telecommunications services sectors.At the same time, Pikes credit profile is supported by favorable industry fundamentals as utilities continue to focus on replacing aging infrastructure, modernizing, and expanding the electricity grid and outsourcing more engineering and construction services to third parties. The companys master service agreements also support revenue stability.The companys liquidity profile is supported by its available revolving credit facility and expected free cash flows. At the end of June 2022, the company had $106 million availability under its $203 million revolver. The revolver has a 5.8x springing senior secured leverage covenant, against which Pike has ample cushion. Pikes liquidity profile was burdened by the spending on a major transmission project in 2021 and the first half of 2022. As the project has been recently completed, we expect working capital release and positive free cash flow in the next 12 months.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe ratings could be upgraded if the company increases its scale and geographic diversity and strengthens its cash generating ability as evidenced by FFO/debt increasing to more than 17.5%, while maintaining good margins and a leverage ratio (debt/EBITDA) below 4.0x.A downgrade could occur if deteriorating operating results, debt-financed acquisitions or shareholder distributions result in the companys leverage ratio increasing to above 5.5x, or FFO/debt sustained below 12.5%. A weakening of its liquidity profile could also result in downward pressure.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Construction published in September 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/74957. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, Pike Corporation provides installation, repair and maintenance and storm restoration services for investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities and telecommunications companies in the United States. The company provides engineering and design services and constructs and maintains substations, underground and overhead distribution networks, and transmission lines. Eric Pike and his affiliates hold approximately 87% of the voting rights and 34% economic interests in the company. Revenue for the twelve months ended March 2022 was approximately $2.1 billion.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Sino-Oceans-senior-unsecured-rating-to-Ba1-assigns--PR_468347,"Moody's downgrades Sino Ocean's senior unsecured rating to Ba1, assigns Ba1 CFR and withdraws Baa3 issuer rating; outlook negative","Hong Kong, August 01, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service has assigned a Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR) to Sino-Ocean Group Holding Limited (Sino-Ocean) and has withdrawn the companys Baa3 issuer rating.At the same time, Moodys has downgraded (1) to Ba1 from Baa3, the senior unsecured ratings on the bonds issued by Sino-Ocean Land Treasure Finance I Limited, Sino-Ocean Land Treasure Finance II Limited and Sino-Ocean Land Treasure IV Limited, and guaranteed by Sino-Ocean; and (2) to Ba3 from Ba2, the rating on the subordinated, guaranteed perpetual capital securities issued by Sino-Ocean Land Treasure III Limited and guaranteed on a subordinated basis by Sino-Ocean.Moodys has also changed the rating outlook on Sino-Ocean and its subsidiaries to negative from ratings under review. This concludes the rating review initiated on 28 June 2022.""The rating downgrades reflect our expectation that support from China Life Insurance Co Ltd (China Life, insurance financial strength rating A1 stable), Sino-Oceans largest shareholder, will reduce over time, as the deterioration in Chinas property market would reduce Sino-Oceans economic and strategic importance to China Life,"" says Cedric Lai, a Moodys Vice President and Senior Analyst.The expectation of lower support results in a reduction of the rating uplift from China Life to one notch from two notches previously.""The negative outlook reflects Sino-Oceans weakening standalone credit profile, driven by declining property sales, weak pricing flexibility due to its thin profit margin and deteriorating financial metrics amid challenging operating conditions,"" adds Lai.RATINGS RATIONALESino-Oceans Ba1 rating incorporates its standalone credit profile and one notch of rating uplift, stemming from support from China Life, in times of need. This view also factors in China Lifes ability to support Sino-Ocean, as illustrated by its A1 insurance financial strength rating (IFSR).The support assumption has considered that Sino-Ocean remains an important equity investment of China Life in the real estate sector. China Life has invested in Sino-Ocean since 2009, and it is China Lifes only investment in an associate in the real estate sector. However, Moodys expects the importance of real estate investment as an asset class for China Life would reduce over the next 12-18 months given the sectors high volatility.Sino-Oceans standalone credit strength reflects its long operating history in the property sector, focus on operating in high-tier Chinese cities, solid access to funding and diversified products, and its recurring income contribution from its investment property portfolio. However, Sin-Oceans credit profile is constrained by the companys weakening sales and financial metrics, and constrained access to capital market funding.Moodys expects Sino-Oceans operating performance to weaken over the next 12-18 months amid difficult operating and funding conditions in China. Specifically, Moodys forecasts Sino-Oceans contracted sales will decline around 25% to around RMB100 billion in 2022, from around RMB136 billion in 2021 due in part to a higher base in the second half of last year. The companys contracted sales decreased 18% during the first six months in 2022 to RMB43.0 billion compared with that during the same period in 2021.Moodys expects Sino Oceans gross margin to reduce to around 16%-17% over the next 12-18 months from 19% in 2021, as the company will likely offer certain price discounts to support its contracted sales amid the difficult market conditions. However, the company has limited pricing flexibility given its low margins.Moodys forecasts the companys debt leverage, as measured by revenue/adjusted debt, will weaken to around 55%-60% over the next 12-18 months from 68% in 2021. Its interest coverage, as measured by adjusted EBIT/interest expenses, will decrease to 2.5x-2.6x over the next 12-18 months from 3.0x in 2021. These forecasts incorporate Moodys expectation of the companys higher debt and gross profit margin decline.Moodys expects Sino-Ocean to maintain good liquidity. The company will have sufficient resources, including unrestricted cash and operating cash flow, to cover its maturing debt over the next 12 months. Its unrestricted cash/short-term debt coverage remained at 1.2x as of the end of 2021. However, the use of internal resources to repay maturing debt could continue to weaken its liquidity buffer over time.Sino-Oceans senior unsecured bond rating is not affected by subordination to claims at the operating company level. Despite Sino-Oceans status as a holding company, Moodys expects support from China Life to Sino-Ocean to flow through the holding company rather than directly to its main operating companies, mitigating potential differences in expected losses that could arise from structural subordination.In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, Moodys has considered the companys (1) strong shareholders and representation on its board of directors; (2) disclosure of material related-party transactions as required by the Corporate Governance Code for companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; and (3) diversified board of directors and four special committees to supervise the companys operations.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSMoodys could downgrade the ratings if the companys sales fall significantly, liquidity weakens, or it undertakes aggressive debt-funded acquisitions that worsen its key credit metrics, such that reported net debt remains elevated, or EBIT/interest falls below 2.5x, on a sustained basis.Moodys could also downgrade the ratings without a decline in the companys standalone credit profile, if Moodys further lowers its assessment of support from China Life for Sino-Ocean. This situation could result from any indication of a reduction in China Lifes ownership of Sino-Ocean; further reduction of Sino-Oceans economic and strategic importance to China Life; or a deterioration in China Lifes own credit profile.An upgrade of Sino-Oceans ratings is unlikely over the next 12 months, given the negative outlook.However, Moodys could revise the outlook to stable if (1) Sino-Ocean demonstrates resilience amid difficult operating conditions through stabilizing its business performance, maintaining its good liquidity and funding assess, as well as disciplined financial management; and (2) China Life continues to provide operational and financial support to Sino-Ocean, in times of need.Credit metrics indicative of a stable outlook includes EBIT/interest above 3.0x on a sustained basis.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Homebuilding And Property Development Industry published in January 2018 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/66220.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Lloyds-Banking-Groups-senior-unsecured-debt-ratings-to--PR_467786,"Moody's downgrades Lloyds Banking Group's senior unsecured debt ratings to A3 from A2, stable outlook maintained","Lloyds Banks senior unsecured debt ratings were affirmed at A1, outlook stableLondon, July 19, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") today downgraded by one notch Lloyds Banking Group plcs (Lloyds Banking Group) senior unsecured debt ratings to A3 from A2, maintaining the stable outlook, and downgraded its other short term rating to (P)P-2 from (P)P-1. Concurrently, Moodys affirmed Lloyds Bank plcs (Lloyds Bank) senior unsecured debt ratings at A1 with a stable outlook.Moodys also downgraded by one notch Lloyds Banking Groups subordinated debt ratings to Baa1 from A3 and its backed junior subordinated debt ratings to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb) and downgraded by one notch Lloyds Banks subordinated debt ratings to Baa1 from A3 and its junior subordinated debt ratings to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb).The rating action had no effect on all other ratings and assessments of Lloyds Banking Group and Lloyds Bank. Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc was not part of todays rating action.For a list of all affected ratings, please refer to the end of this press release.RATINGS RATIONALE-- LOWER SUPPORT FROM THE ADVANCED LOSS GIVEN FAILURE (LGF) ANALYSIS. NO REVIEW OF THE BASELINE CREDIT ASSESSMENTMoodys action only focused on the results from its Advanced Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis. The agencys LGF assessment takes into account the volume and subordination provided by outstanding senior unsecured debt instruments and more junior liability classes, as well as the banking groups medium-term funding plan, balanced against its expected balance sheet evolution.Moodys did not review Lloyds Banks a3 BCA, which remained unchanged.-- DOWNGRADE OF LLOYDS BANKING GROUPS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS, AND OF LLOYDS BANKING GROUPS AND LLOYDS BANKS SUBORDINATED DEBT RATINGSTodays one-notch downgrade of Lloyds Banking Groups senior unsecured debt ratings to A3 from A2 was prompted by the expected reduction in the volume of this loss-absorbing debt class, relative to the future size of the banks balance sheet. This development results in a higher loss severity for senior debt under Moodys Advanced Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis. Moodys LGF analysis now indicates a moderate loss-given-failure for senior unsecured debt, resulting in no uplift from the banks a3 Adjusted BCA, while the previous LGF analysis resulted in a low loss-given-failure and one notch of uplift.Further, todays one-notch downgrade of Lloyds Banking Groups subordinated debt ratings and of Lloyds Banks subordinated and junior subordinated debt was prompted by the expected reduction in the volume of loss-absorbing debt classes junior to them, relative to the size of the banks balance sheet. This development results in a higher loss severity for subordinated debt under Moodys Advanced Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis. Moodys LGF analysis now indicates a high loss-given-failure for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt, resulting in one negative notch from the banks a3 Adjusted BCA, while the previous LGF analysis resulted in a moderate loss-given-failure and no notch of uplift.Moodys continues to assume no government support for all instruments issued by Lloyds Banking Group, the holding company of the group and for the junior instruments of Lloyds Bank, the major operating company of the group.-- AFFIRMATION OF LLOYDS BANKS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGSThe affirmation of Lloyds Banks senior unsecured debt ratings at A1 reflects lower support from Moodys Advanced Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis neutralized by higher levels of government support.Todays affirmation of Lloyds Banks senior unsecured debt was prompted the expected reduction in the volume of loss-absorbing debt classes junior to them, relative to the expected evolution of the banks balance sheet. This development results in a higher loss severity for senior unsecured debt under Moodys Advanced Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis. Moodys LGF analysis now indicates a low loss-given-failure for the banks senior unsecured debt, resulting in one notch uplift from the banks a3 Adjusted BCA, while the previous LGF analysis indicated a very low loss-given-failure resulting in two notches of uplift. However, being considered as a systemically relevant institution, the resulting moderate government support assumption now results in one notch of further rating uplift (from zero notches).-- RATIONALE FOR THE STABLE OUTLOOKThe stable outlook reflects Moodys view that the combined solvency and liquidity metrics will on a forward-looking basis remain in line with our current assessment, as the groups asset quality and profitability stabilizes, following the pandemic-induced deterioration in 2020, taking into account tail winds from rising interest rates and headwinds from current macroeconomic pressures.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSLloyds Banking GroupLloyds Banking Groups long-term ratings could be upgraded following an upgrade of its notional BCA supported by higher capital levels, increased profitability, or lower problem loans. Lloyds Banking Groups senior unsecured debt ratings could also be upgraded following a significant increase in the stock of subordinated debt issued by Lloyds Banking Group or externally by Lloyds Bank.Lloyds Banking Groups ratings could be downgraded following a downgrade of the notional BCA driven by higher problem loans, or a material deterioration in the groups capital and asset risk metrics. The ratings of Lloyds Banking Group could also be downgraded following a reduction in its stock of externally issued unsecured debt.Lloyds BankLloyds Banks BCA could be upgraded if the banks profitability and liquidity buffers improve. An upgrade of the BCA could lead to an upgrade of all long-term ratings of Lloyds Bank, with the exclusion of its senior unsecured debt, as government support would decrease to zero notches from one notch. Lloyds Banks junior debt rating could also be upgraded following a significant increase in the stock of subordinated debt issued by Lloyds Banking Group or externally by Lloyds Bank.Lloyds Banks BCA could be downgraded following (1) a deterioration of the UK operating environment beyond our current expectations, or (2) a material decline in the groups capital metrics. A one notch downgrade of the banks BCA would lead to a downgrade of all its ratings.LIST OF AFFECTED RATINGSIssuer: Lloyds Banking Group plc..Downgrades:....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to A3 from A2, outlook remains Stable....Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program, downgraded to (P)A3 from (P)A2....Subordinate Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa1 from A3....Subordinate Medium-Term Note Program, downgraded to (P)Baa1 from (P)A3....Backed Junior Subordinated Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb)....Other Short Term, downgraded to (P)P-2 from (P)P-1..Outlook Action:....Outlook remains StableIssuer: Lloyds Bank plc..Affirmations:....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable....Backed Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable....Senior Unsecured Shelf, affirmed (P)A1....Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program, affirmed (P)A1....Other Short Term, affirmed (P)P-1..Downgrades:....Subordinate Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa1 from A3....Subordinate Medium-Term Note Program, downgraded to (P)Baa1 from (P)A3....Junior Subordinated Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb)..Outlook Action:....Outlook remains StableIssuer: Cheltenham & Gloucester plc..Downgrade:....Backed Junior Subordinated Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb) (assumed by Lloyds Bank plc)..No Outlook assignedIssuer: HBOS plc..Affirmations:....Long-term Issuer Rating, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable....Short-term Issuer Rating, affirmed P-1..Downgrades:....Subordinate Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa1 from A3....Junior Subordinated Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb)..Outlook Action:....Outlook remains StableIssuer: Bank of Scotland plc..Affirmations:....Long-term Issuer Rating, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable....Backed Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable..Downgrades:....Junior Subordinated Regular Bond/Debenture, downgraded to Baa2(hyb) from Baa1(hyb)..Outlook Action:....Outlook remains StableIssuer: HBOS Treasury Services Ltd..Affirmations:....Backed Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, affirmed A1, outlook remains Stable (assumed by Bank of Scotland plc)..Outlook Action:....Outlook remains StablePRINCIPAL METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Banks Methodology published in July 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/71997.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-a-rating-to-one-class-of-notes-issued--PR_468408,Moody's assigns a rating to one class of notes issued by MF1 2022-FL10 LLC,"New York, August 02, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has assigned a rating to one class of notes issued by MF1 2022-FL10 LLC (the ""Issuer"") as follows:Cl. A, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)The Cl. A notes are referred to herein as the ""Rated Notes.""RATINGS RATIONALEThe rationale for the rating is based on our methodology and considers all relevant risks, particularly those associated with the CRE CLOs portfolio and structure.MF1 2022-FL10 LLC is a managed cash flow commercial real estate CLO (""CRE CLO""). The transaction has a 2-year reinvestment period, which includes a 120-day ramp-up acquisition period, ending in August 2024, after which the transaction will become static. At the closing date, approximately 91.0% of target pool assets are closed, and the additional 9.0%, consisting of identified delayed-close loans that are expected to close by the transaction effective date. The closing date pool is collateralized by 24 commercial real estate interests in the form of first-lien whole mortgages and senior participations secured by 32 multifamily properties. The aggregate principal balance of the collateral interests at closing is $979,175,913; with a fully ramped target collateral balance of $1,025,000,000. The pool consists of 100% floating rate obligations with a 4.12% weighted average spread (WAS). Approximately, 98.9% of the pool assets are indexed to 30-day SOFR and 1.1% is indexed to 1-M LIBOR. Additionally, 100% of the pool assets have index floors with a weighted average floor of 0.90%, with an effective initial pool note rate of 4.12%. The transaction is subject to a series of concentration limits and eligibility criteria during the ramp, reinvestment and amortization periods that includes a weighted average spread (WAS) covenant of 3.70% with no index floors required. The notes on the transaction are floating rate over 30-day SOFR. Moodys considered this in its analysis.The transaction provides for one or more criteria-based loan modifications that are (I) unlimited during the reinvestment period and; (II) limited to eight modifications after the reinvestment period that may include: (i) a change in interest rate (ii) a delay in the required timing of any payment of principal (iii) an increase in the principal balance (iv) an increase in the mezzanine and preferred equity interests in the related borrower subject to limitations; and (iv) an increase in the weighted average life subject to limitations.The transaction closed on August 2, 2022.The expected closing date pool has a Moodys weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 136.1%. Approximately 40.1% of the pool were acquisition financing loans and 59.9% were refinancing loans. The property type exposures are multifamily (including 25.5% of High-Rise, 35.7% of Mid-Rise and 38.8% of Garden). The top ten assets (59.8% of the initial loan pool) and their respective property type and Moodys LTV are as follows:1) 175 West 87th Street  High-Rise  139.2%; 2) Highland Park  Mid-Rise  139.5%; 3) The Madelon  Mid-Rise  139.2%; 4) 15 Park Row  High-Rise  136.3%; 5) 500 Station  Mid-Rise  139.6%; 6) Park at Stone Creek  Garden  138.8%; 7) Elevate Powell & Broad  Garden  139.4%; 8) Gardenhouse  Mid-Rise  118.9%; 9) OKC Portfolio  Garden  124.8%; 10) LA Lofts Portfolio  High-Rise  139.2%.MF1 Collateral Manager, L.L.C (""MF1"") is a multifamily lending platform led by professionals from Limekiln Real Estate and Berkshire Residential Investments is the collateral manager and will manage the CRE CLO. MF1 is led by seasoned professionals with over 13 years of experience in the multifamily B-piece market. This is MF1s tenth securitization of transitional floating rate multifamily mortgage loans. KeyBank National Association will act as servicer, and CBRE Loan Services, Inc. will act as sub-servicer and special servicer. They will provide servicing to the collateral interests during the lifecycle of the transaction. MF1 REIT II-A, L.L.C will act as advancing agent. Wilmington Trust, National Association will serve as trustee and Computershare Trust Company, National Association will serve as note administrator and backup advancing agent on the underlying portfolio.In addition to the Rated Notes, the Issuer issued eight classes of subordinated notes; and one class of income notes.The transaction incorporates par coverage tests which, if triggered, divert interest proceeds to pay down the notes in order of seniority.Moodys has identified the following parameters as key indicators of the expected loss within CRE CLO transactions: weighted average rating factor (WARF), a primary measure of credit quality with credit assessments completed for all of the collateral, weighted average life (WAL), weighted average recovery rate (WARR), number of asset obligors; and pair-wise asset correlation. These parameters are typically modeled as actual parameters for static deals and as covenants for managed deals.For modeling purposes, Moodys used the following base-case assumptions:Par amount: $1,025,000,000Number of obligors: $50,000,000 max. loan size; $50,000,000 max. ramp; 18 min. HerfWeighted Average Rating Factor (WARF): 5000Weighted Average Recovery Rate (WARR): 59.00%Weighted Average Life (WAL): 5.5 yearsWeighted Average Spread (WAS): 3.70%Weighted Average Coupon (WAC): n/aPair-wise asset correlation: 35.0%Methodology Underlying the Rating Action:The principal methodology used in this rating was ""Moodys Approach to Rating SF CDOs"" published in June 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/72732. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Factors That Would Lead to an Upgrade or Downgrade of the Rating:The performance of the Rated Notes is subject to uncertainty. The performance of the Rated Notes is sensitive to the performance of the underlying portfolio, which in turn depends on economic and credit conditions that may change. The Managers investment decisions and management of the transaction will also affect the performance of the Rated Notes.Together with the set of modeling assumptions above, Moodys conducted an additional sensitivity analysis, which was a component in determining the ratings assigned to the Rated Notes. This sensitivity analysis includes increased default probability relative to the base-case.Primary sources of assumption uncertainty are the extent of growth in the current macroeconomic environment.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form. Moodys Rating Symbols and Definitions can be found on https://ratings.moodys.com/rating-definitions.Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on https://ratings.moodys.com/documents/PBS_1337591.The analysis relies on a Monte Carlo simulation that generates a large number of collateral loss or cash flow scenarios, which on average meet key metrics Moodys determines based on its assessment of the collateral characteristics. Moodys then evaluates each simulated scenario using model that replicates the relevant structural features and payment allocation rules of the transaction, to derive losses or payments for each rated instrument. The average loss a rated instrument incurs in all of the simulated collateral loss or cash flow scenarios, which Moodys weights based on its assumptions about the likelihood of events in such scenarios actually occurring, results in the expected loss of the rated instrument.Moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.For ratings issued on a program, series, category/class of debt or security this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series, category/class of debt, security or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moodys rating practices.

Moody's Rating,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/credit-suisse-hit-with-stock-and-credit-downgrades-after-earnings-plunge.html,Credit Suisse hit with stock and credit downgrades after earnings plunge,"Speculation has emerged in recent months that Credit Suisse may be considering a capital raise.Credit Suisse shares slipped on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ""sell"" following credit rating downgrades from Moodys and S&P.The embattled Swiss lenders shares were down slightly by early afternoon trade in London, having recouped some of their earlier losses, and remain down more than 42% year-to-date, as new CEO Ulrich Koerner takes the reins following the resignation of Thomas Gottstein last week.The bank announced a new strategic review after reporting a second-quarter net loss of 1.593 billion Swiss francs ($1.66 billion), well below consensus, as poor investment bank performance and mounting litigation provisions hammered earnings.Goldman Sachs noted on Tuesday that Credit Suisse has underperformed the rest of the sector by 59% since the start of 2021, due to company-specific events and industry-wide obstacles to revenue.The Wall Street giant expects this underperformance to continue over the next 12 months as investment bank returns remain suppressed through to 2024, and projected a pause in near-term wealth management performance due to outflows and subdued market performance.""On capital, while we foresee no near-term shortfall, organic capital generation is below peers and RWA (risk-weighted assets), inflation plus litigation plus restructuring has the potential to further deplete capital to a relatively low buffer vs regulatory minimums,"" Executive Director Chris Hallam and his team said in Tuesdays note.Despite the more favorable picture Goldman sees across the European banking space — in which higher interest rates will boost revenue and returns forecasts, reinvestment in new technology will enhance returns, and excess capital can be distributed to shareholders — Credit Suisse is valued roughly in line with the sector at present.""Our revised 12-month price target implies 5% upside, but in the context of c.60% upside on average across our Banks coverage, this equates to meaningful underperformance: accordingly, we downgrade the stock to Sell from Neutral,"" Goldman said.Credit downgradesMoodys on Monday downgraded Credit Suisses senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings by one notch and maintained a negative outlook on the banks credit trajectory.""The downgrade of CSs ratings reflects the challenges the group is facing in successfully executing on its previously announced repositioning of its investment bank in the more difficult macroeconomic and market environment as well as uncertainty as to the business and financial implications of the groups plans to take further steps to achieve a more stable, capital light and better aligned investment banking business,"" Moodys said in its update.The ratings agency also cited ""the crystallisation of large financial losses during H1 2022, resulting in stress on the banks financial profile and potential delays in technology investments, and in the transformation of the business and an expectation of continued weak performance in 2022."""
Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-PB1-rating-to-Jordans-new-global-medium-term--PR_464864,Moody's assigns (P)B1 rating to Jordan's new global medium-term note programme,"New York, June 06, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today assigned a foreign currency senior unsecured programme rating of (P)B1 to the Government of Jordans global medium-term note programme.According to the transaction documents available to Moodys, the payment obligations associated with notes issued under the programme will be direct, unsecured obligations of the Government of Jordan and rank pari passu with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Notes representing drawdowns from the programme may be denominated in various currencies and consist of different maturities.The Government of Jordan intends to use the net proceeds from each issuance for general budgetary purposes including the refinancing of maturing debt.The rating mirrors Jordans long-term issuer rating of B1.RATINGS RATIONALEJordans B1 rating is supported by the governments commitment to structural economic reforms and medium-term fiscal adjustments, which is strengthened by its participation in its International Monetary Fund programme. Moreover, Jordan outperforms regional peers on government effectiveness and control of corruption, and benefits from broad-based international support in the form of budgetary grants, concessional financing and technical assistance. Access to domestic funding sources is also a credit strength for Jordan.These strengths are balanced against credit challenges posed by the governments very high debt burden, structural rigidities contributing to low economic growth, high unemployment and social pressures, and a volatile regional geopolitical environment. Political instability and armed conflicts in neighbouring countries have weighed on growth by undermining exports, while Jordans comparatively weak external and fiscal positions limit its shock-absorption capacity. Moreover, the large influx of refugees from neighbouring countries, which increased Jordans population by 35% between 2010 and 2017, has put pressure on the countrys infrastructure, public services, and labor market, adding to domestic social pressures while increasing strains on the government budget. Higher global energy and food prices are likely to increase fiscal and social risks.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSJordans ESG Credit Impact Score is highly negative (CIS-4), reflecting its highly negative exposure to environmental and social risks, balanced against relatively strong institutions and governance that provide a degree of resilience.Jordans exposure to environmental risks is highly negative (E-4 issuer profile score), driven mainly by water stress. Jordan is one of the worlds most arid states and rapid population growth in recent years, including due to the influx of refugees from neighboring countries, has increased challenges surrounding water sustainability and management of limited water resources and infrastructure.Its exposure to social risks is highly negative (S-4 issuer profile score). The main source of pressure arises from the labor market because of the very high unemployment rate, especially among the youth, and continued growth in both the population and labor force.The influence of governance on Jordan is neutral to low (G-2 issuer profile). This reflects the countrys track record of reform implementation and fiscal policy effectiveness, as well as relatively strong rule of law and improving control of corruption.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 10,933 (2021 Estimate) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): 2.0% (2021 Estimate) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 2.4% (2021 Estimate)Gen. Gov. Financial Balance/GDP: -7.4% (2021 Estimate) (also known as Fiscal Balance)Current Account Balance/GDP: -11.9% (2021 Estimate) (also known as External Balance)External debt/GDP: 83.2%Economic resiliency: baa2Default history: No default events (on bonds or loans) have been recorded since 1983.On 25 April 2022, a rating committee was called to discuss assigning a provisional rating to the new Global Medium Term Note programme of Jordan, Government of. The main points raised during the discussion were: The terms and conditions of the Global Medium Term Note programme and the conclusion that notes issued under the programme would rank pari passu with all other senior unsecured debt obligations of Jordan, Government of.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGThe rating mirrors Jordans long-term issuer rating of B1. The stable outlook on Jordan indicates balanced risks to the rating.An increasing likelihood that the governments debt burden is on a sustained downward path, achieved through a combination of durable primary fiscal surpluses and higher economic growth rates, would likely lead to an upgrade of the issuer rating. Over time, ongoing reforms that increased Jordans economic competitiveness and raised the economys growth potential would also put upward pressure on the issuer rating.Indications that the governments debt burden is likely to rise markedly and for several years, potentially because of lower effectiveness of the governments fiscal consolidation and/or structural reform policies than Moodys currently expects, would exert negative pressure on the issuer rating. A significant erosion of Jordans foreign exchange reserves would also likely exert downward pressure on the issuer rating, in particular if it pointed to a likely loss of investor confidence that, in turn, raised pressure on government liquidity.The principal methodology used in this rating was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/63168.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Egypts-B2-rating-changes-outlook-to-negative-from--PR_465851,"Moody's affirms Egypt's B2 rating, changes outlook to negative from stable","New York, May 26, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today affirmed the long-term foreign- and local-currency issuer ratings of the Government of Egypt at B2 and changed the outlook to negative from stable. Moodys has also affirmed Egypts foreign-currency senior unsecured ratings at B2, and its foreign-currency senior unsecured MTN program rating at (P)B2.The negative outlook reflects the rising downside risks to the sovereigns external shock absorption capacity in light of a significant narrowing in the foreign exchange reserve buffer to meet upcoming external debt service payments. While the economys external position remains supported by significant financial commitments pledged by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil-exporting sovereigns and the prospect of a new IMF program, tightening global financing conditions increase the risk of weaker recurrent inflows than Moodys currently anticipates to shore up Egypts external position. Susceptibility to event risks is broad-based and includes political risk, especially in the context of a sharp increase in food price inflation which, if not mitigated, could raise social tensions according to Moodys assessment of the relevance of social risks for sovereign credit; while rising domestic borrowing costs, if sustained, will exacerbate liquidity risks and debt affordability challenges, both long-standing weaknesses of Egypts credit profile.The B2 rating remains supported by the governments pro-active crisis response and track record of economic and fiscal reform implementation over the past six years. Egypts broad and dedicated domestic funding base helps weather tightening financing conditions. Egypts strong trend GDP growth supports economic resiliency and the prospect of attracting foreign direct investments in line with the governments privatization strategy.Egypts local-currency (LC) and foreign-currency (FC) ceilings remain unchanged. The LC ceiling at Ba2, three notches above the sovereign rating, acknowledges the public sectors large footprint in the economy that inhibits private sector development and credit allocation, mitigated by a growing track record of implementation of structural competitiveness reforms. The FC ceiling at Ba3, one notch below the LC ceiling, reflects the progressive removal of remaining barriers to capital in- and outflows and a more flexible exchange rate which in Moodys view signal a low risk of transfer and convertibility restrictions, notwithstanding the tighter foreign currency liquidity environment.Please click on this link https://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_ARFTL466319 for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral part of this Press Release and identifies each affected issuer.RATINGS RATIONALERATIONALE FOR CHANGING THE OUTLOOK TO NEGATIVE FROM STABLENARROWER FOREIGN LIQUIDITY BUFFER AMID TIGHTENING EXTERNAL FUNDING CONDITIONS INCREASES BALANCE OF PAYMENTS RISKSThe capital market dislocation triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine, compounded by tightening global monetary policy, has led to a renewed bout of capital outflows by non-resident investors across frontier markets, including in Egypts local currency market, further drawing down the economys external liquidity buffers which had already been weakened during the pandemic. The narrow foreign exchange reserve buffer in comparison with upcoming external debt service payments, and net foreign liability positions at the central bank and in the commercial banking system raise downside risks to the sovereigns external shock absorption capacity amid tight global funding conditions.The fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered non-resident outflows of almost $14 billion as of mid-April from holdings of $31 billion in mid-February. In contrast to previous instances of sharp capital outflows driven by external shocks such as in the second half of 2018 or at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the most recent external shock has materialized when the economys liquid foreign exchange reserve buffer at $29.3 billion in April [1] was already weakened by the pandemic and higher imports to fuel the recovery. The absorption of capital outflows through the banking system has created a net liability position in the monetary system comprising both the central bank and commercial banks of $12 billion in March, a reading not recorded since before the flotation of the pound in November 2016. In Moodys assessment, the coverage of this net liability position with foreign exchange reserves to buttress banks counterparty risk standing reduces the amount of usable reserves to meet renewed external shocks.Immediate balance of payment risks are mitigated by $22 billion in financial commitments by GCC sovereigns - of which $11 billion are already deposited in support of FX reserves, and the remainder pledged as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and asset purchases - and by the prospect of a new IMF program. However, in Moodys assessment continued foreign exchange reserve coverage of upcoming external debt service payments over the next three years at about $25-30 billion (including short-term plus medium/long-term external debt maturities) will depend on continued inflows from abroad. While Moodys expects the governments privatization strategy aiming for $10 billion in FDI inflows annually over four years to help bolster Egypts FX reserve buffer in the future, the likelihood of renewed large-scale inflows is low in the near future in Moodys assessment, raising downside risks.INFLATION SHOCK RAISES BORROWING COSTS, EXACERBATING DEBT AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES, AND SOCIAL RISKSAlready weak debt affordability as measured by interest/revenue is exacerbated by higher domestic borrowing costs amid rising inflation, increasing funding needs and, over time, crowding out spending for social, investment or security purposes.Egypts debt affordability as measured by general government interest/revenue Moodys estimates at over 45% and interest/GDP at about 9% in fiscal 2022 is very weak globally, exposing fiscal accounts to tightening borrowing costs. Over the past two months the central bank of Egypt has raised the monetary policy rate by a cumulative 300 basis points in response to surging inflation at 13.1% year over year in April [2], driven by the fallout from pandemic-related supply disruptions, soaring global food and energy prices, and the repercussion of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound by about 14% in March. The already large interest bill and the large gross borrowing requirements at over 30% of GDP characterize Egypt as among the sovereigns most sensitive to tightening funding conditions, especially in the local currency market.While Moodys projects the central banks monetary policy actions to keep inflation expectations in check thereby contributing to a stabilization and eventual improvement in debt affordability, over time, the larger interest bill crowds out other spending for social, investment or security purposes. Combined with the negative impact of inflation on living standards - food accounts for more than 30% of the consumption basket -, this points to potentially increasing social risks in Moodys assessment.RATIONALE FOR AFFIRMING THE B2 RATINGThe B2 rating incorporates Egypts track record of economic resiliency based on strong economic growth projected at 5.5% in fiscal 2022 and 4.5% in fiscal 2023 before reverting to trend growth at 5% thereafter, and on the governments crisis management capacity underpinning its institutions and governance strength.The track record of improved policy effectiveness supports the governments structural economic reform agenda to enhance export competitiveness, broaden the revenue base, and a shift to targeted income support measures as well as the maintenance of primary surpluses underpinning Moodys expectation of a renewed reduction in the debt/GDP ratio starting fiscal 2023. Despite the larger interest bill, Moodys projects the general government debt ratio to resume its downward trajectory toward 85% of GDP in 2025, after a renewed increase to 93.5% of GDP in fiscal 2022 as a result of the valuation effect from the currency depreciation.The B2 rating also incorporates the large and dedicated domestic funding base to meet the governments large borrowing requirements, including during times of non-resident outflows, supported by a lengthening maturity profile, a more diversified investor base and the maintenance of market access.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSEgypts ESG Credit Impact Score is highly negative (CIS-4), reflecting high exposure to environmental and social risks respectively. The sovereigns high debt burden, relatively low income levels and moderate governance strength constrain its capacity to respond to environmental and social risks, although remedy strategies are being implemented.Egypts highly negative exposure to environmental risks (E-4 issuer profile score) mainly relates to high water risk through the countrys dependency on the Nile and the high degree of air pollution in densely populated cities. The Niles flow has been affected by the decreasing rate of annual rainwater, leading to very high fresh water resource depletion rates which the government seeks to address via the installation of desalination plants and the application of strict rules for the cultivation of water-intensive crops such as rice and sugarcane. As climate change intensifies, Egypt is also among the sovereigns most exposed to rising sea levels, with up to 10%-25% of the population or GDP exposed over the next decades.Exposure to social risks is high (S-4 issuer profile score), driven by low employment rates that constrain the absorption of the young and expanding labor force, resulting in high youth unemployment rates at over 25% of the labor force, including among graduates. Relatively high poverty rates and gender inequality also contribute to social risks which have been exacerbated by the large economic reform adjustment costs borne by consumers over the past few years. Although the breadth of coverage remains relatively narrow, as part of the governments reform effort, social risks are being mitigated by a more targeted social safety net.Egypt has a moderately negative governance profile score (G-3 issuer profile), reflecting weak performance on voice and accountability and the perception of relatively few formal checks on the exercise of government power, including from the side of civil society. In recent years, significant progress in the implementation of economic and fiscal reforms denote some improvements in government effectiveness.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 12,823 (2020 Actual) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): 3.6% (2020 Actual) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 5.7% (2020 Actual)Gen.

The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuers economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have not materially changed. The issuers institutions and governance strength, have not materially changed. The issuers fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has not materially changed. The issuer has become increasingly susceptible to event risks.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSGiven the negative outlook, an upgrade is unlikely in the near future. Evidence of a renewed build-up in the monetary systems net foreign asset position that is likely to be sustained and a strengthening foreign exchange reserve buffer to meet external debt service payments and commensurate with Egypts adopted economic model based on an open capital account and relative exchange rate stability would likely lead Moodys to stabilize the outlook. Over time, evidence of a sustained improvement in non-hydrocarbon exports/GDP would also contribute to positive momentum by signaling higher competitiveness while also supporting Egypts external debt affordability.Worsening balance of payment dynamics that further erode liquid foreign exchange reserves and threaten external stability would likely prompt a downgrade, as would a persistently negative net foreign asset position in the monetary system. A sustained and material deterioration in already weak debt affordability would also be credit negative. Relatedly, an erosion in policy effectiveness and credibility or rising social and political risk that contributes to raising the cost of government debt and/or eroding competitiveness, would also exert negative pressure on the rating.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/63168.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Bed-Bath-Beyonds-CFR-to-B2--PR_465907,Moody's downgrades Bed Bath & Beyond's CFR to B2,"New York, May 16, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service, (""Moodys"") downgraded Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.s (""Bed Bath"") corporate family rating (""CFR"") to B2 from B1, its probability of default rating to B2-PD from B1-PD and its senior unsecured notes rating to B3 from B2. The speculative grade liquidity rating was downgraded to SGL-2 from SGL-1. The outlook is stable.""The downgrade reflects the continued pressure on Bed Baths operations and credit metrics given the increased risks associated with the execution of Bed Baths strategic turnaround. Supply chain and operational challenges are expected to continue to constrain inventory levels leading to further market share erosion as inflation in food and energy costs weigh on discretionary income,"" said Christina Boni, Moodys Senior Vice President. ""Leverage at the end of fiscal 2021 was approximately 4.7x and is expected to increase to around 5.0x at the end of fiscal 2022 as weaker sales and higher supply chain costs reduce its profitability,"" she added. The downgrade to SGL-2 reflects that free cash flow is expected to be negative in fiscal 2022 and its $1 billion revolver will be utilized seasonally.Downgrades:..Issuer: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.....

Despite its scale as the largest dedicated retailer of domestic merchandise and home furnishing with a national footprint, the company faces considerable risk associated with its operational turnaround. Nonetheless, the company maintains good liquidity and a low level of funded debt, both of which provide it with the financial flexibility to support its efforts to improve profitability. The company continues to face increased supply chain pressures that have resulted in higher costs and lower inventory availability.Demand shifted to the home segment during the pandemic, which is at risk of normalization as consumers face higher costs. Nonetheless, Bed Bath has been successful in growing its e-commerce business significantly to approximately 37% of its overall sales. Despite these efforts, the company remains vulnerable to intense competition from e-commerce as well as other value players and traditional discounters. Bed Bath is focused on improving assortments and layout, expanding private label, and enhancing its omni-channel capabilities and upgrading its systems as its works to reduce costs. Bed Bath has worked to rationalize its banners as well as its store base with a total of 63 completed in fiscal 2021.Bed Baths SGL-2 reflects its good liquidity with cash in excess of $300 million expected at the end of 2022 and the revolver to be used only for seasonal purposes. Moodys expects share repurchases will not be resumed until operational performance returns to more historical levels. Bed Bath has also continued to make strategic capital expenditures and is expected to spend $400 million in fiscal 2022. Bed Baths nearest note maturity is $285 million in 2024 with its undrawn $1 billion ABL at fiscal 2021 year end expiring in August 2026.The stable outlook reflects its good liquidity and manageable debt maturities profile which gives Bed Bath time to enact its operational turnaround. The outlook reflects Moodys view that further shareholder returns before profitability consistently improves would be viewed as aggressive.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSRatings could be downgraded to the extent that the transformation does not result in operational improvement, market share erosion is sustained, liquidity deteriorates for any reason or financial strategy becomes more aggressive. Quantitatively, ratings could be downgraded if debt/EBITDA is sustained above 5.5x or EBIT/interest is sustained below 1.0x.An upgrade would require that the company maintains good liquidity and makes significant progress in its operational initiatives which results in positive free cash flow and market share stabilization while debt/EBITDA is sustained below 4.5x and EBIT/Interest is sustained above 1.25x.Headquartered in Union, NJ, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is a omni-channel retailer selling a wide assortment of domestics merchandise and home furnishings which operates under the names Bed Bath & Beyond, Harmon, Harmon Face Values or Face Values, buybuyBABY, and Decorist.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-El-Salvadors-ratings-to-Caa3-from-Caa1-maintains--PR_464838,Moody's downgrades El Salvador's ratings to Caa3 from Caa1; maintains negative outlook,"New York, May 04, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") has today downgraded the Government of El Salvadors long-term foreign-currency issuer rating and long-term foreign-currency senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa3 from Caa1. The outlook is negative.Moodys decision to downgrade El Salvadors ratings reflects an increased probability of a credit event  restructuring, distressed exchange, or default  with relatively high severity, as the sovereign faces a challenging debt amortization schedule with bond maturities in 2023 and 2025 in a context of continued funding stress and persistently high financing needs.The negative outlook on the Caa3 rating reflects Moodys view that in the event of a default losses to investors could exceed those typically associated with a Caa3 rating.Concurrently, Moodys has lowered El Salvadors foreign-currency country ceiling to Caa1 from B2, maintaining the existing two-notch gap between the sovereign rating and the foreign-currency ceiling to reflect the low predictability of institutions and government policies, weak policy effectiveness and the governments relatively large share in the countrys total external debt. We do not assign a local currency country ceiling for El Salvador because the country is fully dollarized.RATINGS RATIONALERATIONALE FOR THE DOWNGRADE TO Caa3The downgrade of El Salvadors rating is driven in good part by the lack of a credible financing plan, a factor that heightens credit risks derived from restricted market access given the distressed yields on El Salvadors external debt. The downgrade incorporates Moodys expectation of high material losses to investors ahead of the two upcoming bond redemptions. Even if the government finds a way to manage near-term financing pressures from the upcoming 2023 bond maturity, Moodys view is that the sovereign will continue to face funding pressures that would compromise its ability to service its debt commitments in full.El Salvadors repayment capacity is compromised by an extremely high cost of funding ahead of a challenging debt amortization schedule that includes bond maturities of $800 million in January 2023 and again in January 2025. High yields on the sovereigns outstanding external market debt, with sovereign spreads in excess of 2,200 basis points, and reliance on costly short-term domestic debt have led to a material increase in credit risks. Although the sovereigns liquidity pressures have eased somewhat as a result of last years record-high 26.9% increase in tax receipts, Moodys believes that liquidity pressures will intensify in the second half of 2022 and through the upcoming $800 million bond maturity in January 2023.Moodys estimates indicate that El Salvador will likely face a funding gap of about 1% of GDP this year as the government moves to cover financing needs equivalent to 16.2% of GDP. Funding pressures will remain high as next years financing needs, which include Januarys $800 million principal payment of the 2023 bond, are forecasted to amount to 17% of GDP.The government has announced its intention to reform the pension system, which Moodys thinks could free up liquidity to meet the 2023 bond payment. However, as no details have been provided to date, sovereign credit risks remain elevated. In addition to risks associated to the financing of the 2023 bond redemption, the underlying strength of El Salvadors credit profile is also undermined by low debt affordability. The ratio of interest payments-to-revenue reached 18.4% in 2021 and Moodys forecasts it will remain above 18% through 2024.RATIONALE FOR THE NEGATIVE OUTLOOKThe negative outlook on the Caa3 rating reflects the likelihood that tightening external financial conditions and a limited availability of funding alternatives could result in losses to investors that would exceed those consistent with a Caa3 rating. Furthermore, government decisions that have repeatedly prioritized political considerations over economic ones have undermined policy predictability, including what terms the government could seek in the event of a debt restructuring.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSEl Salvadors ESG Credit Impact Score is highly negative (CIS-4), reflecting moderate exposure to environmental risk, highly negative exposure to social risks and very highly negative governance issuer profile score with limited financial resilience.El Salvadors exposure to environmental risks is moderately negative (E-3 issuer profile score), related to physical climate change and limited natural capital. El Salvadors geography is dominated by a region known as the Dry Corridor, characterized by heavy precipitation events that lead to flooding and landslides and occasional droughts. The steady rise in the frequency and severity of droughts and other climate-related shocks poses a threat to the countrys agriculture sector, which employs 16% of the population. Extreme weather events can lead to volatility in some of El Salvadors key credit metrics, including GDP growth, household incomes and agricultural export earnings.Exposure to social risks is highly negative (S-4 issuer profile score). El Salvadors homicide rate is one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere and is emblematic of the countrys weak domestic security, a key driver behind the significant emigration of its residents to the US. While remittances from El Salvadorans living abroad support about 25% of economic activity, which boosts consumption, high levels of violence and insecurity stunt the countrys investment levels, productivity and long-term growth potential.The influence of governance on El Salvadors credit profile is very highly negative (G-5 issuer profile score) reflecting its weak government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption. A deteriorating predictability of institutions and government actions also undermines the governance issuer profile score.GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 8,498 (2020 Actual) (also known as Per Capita Income)Real GDP growth (% change): -7.9% (2020 Actual) (also known as GDP Growth)Inflation Rate (CPI, % change Dec/Dec): 0.5% (2020 Actual)Gen.

The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuers fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has materially decreased. The issuer has become increasingly susceptible to event risks.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGSEvidence that sufficient financing at more affordable rates will be available to cover the sovereigns funding needs over the medium term would decrease potential losses to bondholders and the likelihood of a credit event, supporting a higher rating.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSDownward pressure on the sovereigns credit profile would emerge if Moodys were to conclude that losses to investors from a possible restructuring of government debt would exceed those consistent with a Caa3 rating. A worsening of El Salvadors funding prospects, or the governments inability to come up with measures to alleviate liquidity pressures ahead of a challenging debt maturity schedule would further undermine El Salvadors credit profile.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Sovereign Ratings Methodology published in November 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1158631.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-PEMEXs-ratings-to-B1-outlook-changed-to-stable--PR_467706,Moody's downgrades PEMEX's ratings to B1; outlook changed to stable,"New York, July 11, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) downgraded Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) corporate family rating and the senior unsecured ratings on the companys existing notes, as well as the ratings based on PEMEXs guarantee, to B1 from Ba3. Moodys also affirmed PEMEXs Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA), which reflects its standalone credit strength, at caa3. These rating actions were triggered by Moodys announcement on July 8, 2022 that it had downgraded its ratings on the Government of Mexicos to Baa2 from Baa1 and changed the outlook on the governments ratings to stable from negative. The outlook on Pemexs ratings is now stable.Affirmations:..Issuer: Petroleos Mexicanos.... Baseline Credit Assessment, Affirmed caa3Downgrades:..Issuer: Petroleos Mexicanos....Corporate Family Rating, Downgraded to B1 from Ba3....Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program, Downgraded to (P)B1 from (P)Ba3....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Downgraded to B1 from Ba3..Issuer: Pemex Project Funding Master Trust....Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program, Downgraded to (P)B1 from (P)Ba3....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Downgraded to B1 from Ba3Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Pemex Project Funding Master Trust....Outlook, Changed To Stable From Negative..Issuer: Petroleos Mexicanos....Outlook, Changed To Stable From NegativeRATINGS RATIONALEThe downgrade on PEMEXs ratings to B1 from Ba3 was prompted by the downgrade of Mexicos rating, given the critical importance of the governments financial strength and support in the assessment of PEMEXs credit profile due to its high liquidity risk. The action also considered PEMEXs high debt maturities in 2022-24 and Moodys expectations for continued negative free cash flow and the need for large amounts of external funding given persistent loses at the companys refining business, the necessity to maintain capex at least at current levels to sustain production and reserves stable, and high interest expenses. The action also took into account that PEMEXs access to the capital markets is currently limited given its high intrinsic credit risk.Elevated oil prices in 2022-23 in comparison with 2020-21 levels will support higher cash generation at PEMEXs exploration and production (E&P) business in the period but will simultaneously increase royalties and operating costs at the refining business. Although oil and gas production growth has been below management targets, it is positive that, since 2019, PEMEX has been successful in maintaining production and reserves relatively stable. However, Moodys estimates that, in 2022-24, the company will only be able to sustain production and reserves at current levels given its inability to invest larger sums of capital in E&P.PEMEXs B1 rating takes into consideration Moodys joint default analysis, which includes the rating agencys assumptions of very high government support in case of need and very high default correlation between PEMEX and the Government of Mexico, resulting in five notches of uplift from the companys caa3 BCA. Since 2016, and most importantly and increasingly from 2019 to 2021, the government has supported PEMEX in various ways, including capital injections, tax reductions, and early redemption of notes receivable from the government. Moodys assumes that the government, as promised, will continue to fund PEMEXs cash needs and help the company to comply with its debt amortization obligations of $5.1 billion in 2022, $7.5 billion in 2023, and $8.9 billion in 2024, as of March 2022.PEMEX has weak liquidity and is highly dependent on government support. On March 31, 2022 the company had $2.4 billion in cash and no availability under its committed revolving credit facilities to address debt maturities. In addition, Moodys estimates that PEMEX will have substantial negative free cash flow in the next 12-18 months, driven by insufficient operating cash generation to pay interest expenses, taxes, and capital spending.The stable outlook on PEMEXs ratings is based on Moodys expectation that the companys business strategy and financial profile will remain unchanged in the next 12-18 months; it also considers the current stable outlook on Mexicos ratings.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSA downgrade of Mexicos Baa2 rating would likely result in a downgrade of PEMEXs rating. For an affirmation of PEMEXs B1 rating following a sovereign downgrade, the companys BCA would have to substantially improve. Because PEMEXs rating is highly dependent on support from the Government of Mexico, a change in Moodys assumptions about government support and its timeliness could lead to a downgrade of PEMEXs rating. A lowering of the BCA could also lead to a downgrade of PEMEXs rating. Factors that could lead to a lower BCA include material increases in net debt, an operating performance worse than forecasted, reserve declines and decreases in reserve life.Conversely, an upgrade of Mexicos Baa2 rating could result in an upgrade of PEMEXs rating given the importance of the government in providing support to the companys liquidity needs. In addition, factors that could lead to a higher BCA and potentially a higher rating for PEMEX would include its ability to strengthen its liquidity position and internally fund sufficient capital reinvestment to fully replace reserves, deliver modest production growth and generate free cash flow for debt reduction.ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONSPEMEXs ESG Credit Impact Score is very highly negative (CIS-5). In addition to having very high environmental risk exposure and high social risk exposure, PEMEX has very high governance risk, including weak financial strategy and risk management, weak board structure, and policies and procedures.PEMEX has a very highly negative exposure to environmental risk (E-5 Issuer Profile Score) mainly driven by very high carbon transition risk, high natural capital risk, high water management risk, and high waste and pollution risk. Integrated companies with high exposure to upstream business will face increasing pressure over time, particularly oil producers, as decarbonization efforts and the transition towards cleaner energy continues.PEMEX has a very highly negative exposure to social risks (S-5 Issuer Profile Score) mainly driven by health and safety, responsible production, and demographic & societal pressures. Other drivers include weak customer relations and high human capital risk.Governance risks are very highly negative (G-5 Issuer Profile Score) and linked primarily to financial strategy and risk management, in addition to board structure, policies and procedures, and track record. There is very high risk related to liquidity and leverage. PEMEX has significant ownership concentration.The methodologies used in these ratings were Integrated Oil and Gas Methodology published in September 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/64319, and Government-Related Issuers Methodology published in February 2020 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/64864. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.Founded in 1938, PEMEX is Mexicos national oil company, with fully integrated operations in oil and gas exploration and production, refining, distribution and retail marketing, as well as petrochemicals. PEMEX is also a leading crude oil exporter, around 60% of its crude is exported to various countries, mainly to the US and Asia. In the three months ended March 31, 2022 the company produced an average of 1,755 thousand barrels of per day of crude oil (excluding partners).REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

Moody's Rating,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Range-Resources-to-Ba2--PR_466380,Moody's upgrades Range Resources to Ba2,"New York, May 31, 2022 -- Moodys Investors Service (""Moodys"") upgraded Range Resources Corporations (Range) Corporate Family Rating (CFR) to Ba2 from Ba3, Probability of Default Rating (PDR) to Ba2-PD from Ba3-PD, and senior unsecured notes to Ba3 from B1. The Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was upgraded to SGL-1 from SGL-2. The rating outlook was changed to stable from positive.""The upgrade reflects improved credit metrics for Range, and our expectation of continued debt reduction using the meaningful free cash flow the company will generate,"" said Arvinder Saluja, Moodys Vice President. ""Range has continued to focus on maintaining capital discipline despite higher natural gas and NGLs prices, and has made public commitments to prioritize further deleveraging.""Upgrades:..Issuer: Range Resources Corporation.... Corporate Family Rating, Upgraded to Ba2 from Ba3.... Probability of Default Rating, Upgraded to Ba2-PD from Ba3-PD.... Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating, Upgraded to SGL-1 from SGL-2.... Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to Ba3 (LGD4) from B1 (LGD5)Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Range Resources Corporation....Outlook, Changed To Stable From PositiveRATINGS RATIONALERanges upgrade to a Ba2 CFR is supported by the meaningful improvement in its credit metrics that can be sustained through price cycles, especially retained cash flow to debt and leveraged full-cycle ratio (LFCR), and Moodys expectation of further debt reduction in 2022-23. Range has a publicly-stated balance sheet target of $1 - $1.5 billion of debt. In the first quarter of 2022, the company reduced $350 million of debt and in the second quarter redeemed $218 million 2022 notes. It has $532 million of senior notes due 2023 which become callable in the fourth quarter, giving a clear view of additional near-term debt reduction. Ranges low-cost structure and capital discipline will help the company generate sizeable free cash flow in an improved commodity price backdrop for both natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).Moodys expects Range to continue to optimize its operating and development costs. The CFR is also supported by Ranges strong operating efficiency, scale, relatively high proportion of NGLs in the production mix, and good asset-based leverage metrics. In addition, Range benefits from long-lived reserves, conservative financial policies, and a high level of operational control over its reserves, enabling significant discipline over the pace of future development. However, Ranges ratings are constrained by its sensitivity to volatile natural gas and NGLs prices, with natural gas contributing about 70% of production, exposure to Appalachian basin natural gas takeaway constraints with ~20% of gas currently priced locally, and high geographic concentration.Ranges improved credit metrics, liquidity, and balance sheet strength will bolster its capacity to withstand negative credit impacts from carbon transition risks, with its lower debt levels and natural gas and NGL focus enhancing its relative positioning in future energy transition scenarios. While financial performance of Range will continue to be influenced by industry cycles, compared to historical experience Moodys expects future profitability and cash flow in this sector to be less robust at the cycle peak and worse at the cycle trough because global initiatives to limit adverse impacts of climate change will constrain the use of hydrocarbons and accelerate the shift to less environmentally damaging energy sources.Moodys expects Range to have very good liquidity in 2022-23 as reflected by the SGL-1 Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating, underpinned by positive free cash flow generation even at mid-cycle natural gas and NGL prices. As of March 31, 2022 Range had no borrowings and $338 million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolver. In April, Range amended its revolving bank facility and downsized its revolver to $1.5 billion with a new maturity date of April 2027, giving it pro forma borrowing capacity of just under $1.2 billion. The committed borrowing base for the amended revolving credit facility remains $3 billion. The credit agreement governing the revolver contains financial maintenance covenants requiring a minimum current ratio of 1x and maximum net leverage of 3.75x. Moodys expects Range to maintain ample cushion under its financial covenants. The companys next maturity occurs in the first quarter of 2023 with about $532 million of debt coming due.Ranges senior unsecured notes are rated Ba3, one notch below the assigned Ba2 CFR, due to their structural subordination to the companys $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSAn upgrade could be considered if Range gets closer to achieving its balance sheet debt target and continues to produce free cash flow on a consistent basis, and if retained cash flow to debt is sustained above 40% and leveraged full cycle ratio (LFCR) approaches 2x under Moodys medium term price assumptions. Ranges ratings could be downgraded if retained cash flow to debt and LFCR fell below 25% and toward 1.25x, respectively, or the company generated substantial negative free cash flow.Range Resources Corporation is an independent exploration and production company that is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Independent Exploration and Production published in August 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/74836.
