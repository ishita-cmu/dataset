"London, August 12, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has today downgraded the Government of Turkiye's long-term foreign- and domestic-currency issuer and the foreign-currency senior unsecured ratings to B3 from B2.The foreign-currency senior unsecured shelf rating was downgraded to (P)B3 from (P)B2.",1
The authorities are having to resort to increasingly unorthodox measures in an attempt to stabilize the currency and restore foreign-currency buffers.,0
"In Moody's view, it is unlikely that the increasingly complex set of regulatory, fiscal and macroprudential measures will be effective in restoring some degree of macroeconomic stability.",1
Moody's considers this a Governance driver under its ESG framework.,1
The stable outlook reflects Moody's view that the risks at the B3 level are balanced.,1
Concurrently Moody's lowered Turkiye's local-currency country ceiling to B1 from Ba3 previously.,1
"At that point, Moody's expects pressure on the exchange rate and the CBRT's foreign-currency buffer to increase again.",1
"Moody's estimates confidence-sensitive external refinancing needs at around $128 billion or 17% of GDP, primarily owed by the private sector.",1
"In contrast, the government has only one external bond maturity left in September for $2.5 billion plus interest and loan repayments of a further $3.2 billion from July-December, which could be covered out of its foreign-currency deposits at the CBRT of around $11 billion in case of tighter financing conditions.",0
"According to Moody's latest forecasts, consumer price inflation will still stand at close to 70% at year-end.",1
"New measures have been announced ever more frequently and have become increasingly unorthodox, such as the requirement for exporters to convert 40% of their export earnings into lira with the CBRT and the prohibition for banks to extend credit to firms holding material foreign-currency assets.",0
"Also, bank lending rates have risen to over 30% in recent weeks, significantly above the CBRT's policy rate at 14%, which should help to dampen demand for credit.",0
"However, in Moody's view it is unlikely that the increasingly complex set of regulatory and macroprudential measures will be effective in restoring some degree of macroeconomic stability and sustainably help to bring down inflation.",1
"While Moody's expects a gradual economic slowdown in the second half of this year and into next year  the rating agency forecasts real GDP growth of 4.5% and 2% for 2022 and 2023 respectively, the risk of a sharper slowdown is material.",1
"At the same time, it is unclear whether there is political acceptance that the Turkish economy will need to slow down, in particular in light of the approaching elections, which will have to be held by June 2023 at the latest.",0
Moody's expects a material weakening of Turkiye's public finances this year.,1
"The cost to the Treasury of the deposit protection scheme is rising, with Moody's estimating the full-year cost at around 2.2% of GDP, on the basis of the rating agency's exchange rate forecasts.",1
"Similarly, the cost of inflation-indexed debt which is mostly held by domestic banks has risen substantially, and Moody's estimates that high inflation will add around 1.2% of GDP in interest payments this year compared to 2021.",1
"The rating agency expects a budget deficit of around 4.5% of GDP, also reflecting the slowdown in the economy, a higher wage and public-sector pension bill as well as earlier tax reductions.",1
"Banks and corporates  the main borrowers abroad  have been able to roll over maturing debt during previous periods of financial stress and have not encountered any difficulties so far this year and have well-hedged foreign-currency positions, which provides a cushion against future episodes of financial stress.",0
Turkiye's social IPS is also moderately negative (S-3).,1
The overall provision of basic services such as safe drinking water and sanitation services to the population is uneven across the country.,0
Turkiye's institutions and governance profile has deteriorated steadily in recent years and has been a key driver of successive downgrades to the sovereign's rating.,1

"Toronto, July 29, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed all of Strathcona Resources Ltd.'s (Strathcona) ratings, including its B2 corporate family rating (CFR), its B2-PD probability of default rating, and the B3 rating on its senior unsecured notes.",1
"The acquisition will be funded through borrowings on Strathcona's revolving credit facility, with total committed borrowing capacity increased to C$2 billion (from C$1.5 billion), and through a C$700 million term loan.",0
"""The affirmation and maintenance of the positive outlook reflects Strathcona's sizable production and reserve base pro forma for the complimentary Serafina acquisition,"" said Moody's analyst Paresh Chari.",1
"Strathcona's liquidity is significantly diminished by the acquisition, but is adequate.",0
"Proforma for the Serafina acquisition and new debt instruments, Moody's expects minimal cash and about C$200 million of availability under its C$2 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in February 2026).",1
Moody's expects about $450 million of free cash flow through to mid-2023 using Moody's medium term price assumptions and much higher if current market prices were to persist.,1
Strathcona will also need to fund the deferred payments of C$400 million from September to December 2022 which Moody's expects will be funded using revolver availability and free cash flow.,1
Moody's expects Strathcona will be in compliance with its three financial covenants through to mid-2023.,1
Moody's Loss Given Default for Speculative-Grade Companies (LGD) methodology suggests that the notes be ranked two notches below Strathcona's B2 CFR due to the size and priority ranking of the company's C$2 billion first lien revolver and C$700 million first lien term loan due 2024 (revolver and term loan are pari passu) relative to the unsecured US$500 million notes due 2026 in the company's capital structure.,1
"However, given the positive outlook on Strathcona's CFR, strong asset coverage, Moody's views the assigned B3 rating as more appropriate.",1
The positive outlook is supported by Moody's expectation that Strathcona's credit metrics and liquidity will improve with debt reduction funded by free cash flow and that production will modestly grow over the next 12 to 18 months.,1
"Strathcona Resources Ltd. is an oil and gas producer headquartered in Calgary Alberta, with producing assets located across Western Canada.",0

"Upstart Network, Inc. (""Upstart"") will act as the servicer of the loans.",0
Moody's median cumulative net loss expectation for the 2022-4 pool is 16.9% and the stress loss is 58.0%.,1
"Moody's based its cumulative net loss expectation on an analysis of the credit quality of the underlying collateral; the historical performance of similar collateral, including securitization performance and managed portfolio performance; the ability of Upstart to perform its servicing functions; the ability of Wilmington and its sub-agent to perform the backup servicing functions; and current expectations for the macroeconomic environment during the life of the transaction.",1
"As such, regulatory and borrower challenges to marketplace lenders and their third-party lending partners over ""true lender"" status and interest rate exportation could result in some of Upstart's loans being deemed void or unenforceable, in whole or in part.",0
"Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.",1
"Moody's expectation of pool losses could decline as a result of better than expected improvements in the economy, changes to servicing practices that enhance collections or refinancing opportunities that result in prepayments.",1
"Moody's expectation of pool losses may increase, for example, due to performance deterioration stemming from a downturn in the US economy, deficient servicing, errors on the part of transaction parties, inadequate transaction governance or fraud.",1

"New York, July 20, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s (T-Mobile) senior unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Ba2 and affirmed the Baa3 rating on the company's existing senior secured notes and senior secured revolving credit facility.",1
"As a consequence of this rating action, Moody's fully expects T-Mobile will release all of the collateral underlying its existing senior secured notes through an Investment Grade Event Election option available to it under its secured bond indenture.",1
"Moody's has also withdrawn T-Mobile's Ba1 corporate family rating, Ba1-PD probability of default rating and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating.",1
"With this rating action, Moody's changed T-Mobile's ratings outlook to stable from positive.",1
"Moody's views network investments, including spectrum investments, as supportive of the business profile.",1
The multi-year integration of the wireless network of Sprint into the legacy T-Mobile network has progressed far ahead of the target objectives set at the merger date in 2020.,0
"Synergies will exceed Moody's early expectations by over 25%, delivering high run rate cost efficiencies that will further bolster ramping free cash flow.",1
"Moody's expects the company will rapidly upgrade or decommission all legacy Sprint network tower sites by year-end 2022, with a meaningful pick-up in this activity beginning in the second half of 2022.",1
Predominantly all of legacy Sprint customer traffic is now carried on the T-Mobile network.,0
"With over two years of solid network and operations integration completed, Moody's views the potential for execution missteps which could result in service quality deterioration and associated customer churn fallout as a low, remote and quickly abating risk.",1
"Moody's expects that T-Mobile's debt leverage (Moody's adjusted) will fall to near 3.7x by year-end 2022 on a before merger related/Covid-19 costs basis, even after factoring in debt leverage impacts (Moody's adjusted) from potential future debt-funded spectrum investments.",1
"Moody's further expects T-Mobile's organic growth and continued progress on cost synergies will enable it to generate positive free cash flow in the mid-single digits as a percentage of revenue by year-end 2022, with ramping expansion thereafter.",1
"While T-Mobile's growing free cash flow can enable targeted share buybacks, Moody's expects such shareholder friendly actions will be prudent, measured and ultimately constrained by Board-enforced and company-defined debt targets.",1
"Moody's believes that T-Mobile's steadily improving cost structure will enable it to adequately invest in its network to remain competitive, including in future spectrum-based capacity enhancements and potential fiber investments if necessary to deliver evolving 5G technology applications while competing at discounted price points relative to its nationwide wireless peers.",1
"T-Mobile's increased operating scale now enables it to better pursue opportunities in several under-indexed markets, including in more rural and enterprise end markets.",0
"In addition, T-Mobile could benefit from its affiliation with its controlling shareholder Deutsche Telekom AG (DT, Baa1 stable), although Moody's does not impute any credit support to the rating from DT.",1
Moody's expects that T-Mobile will maintain good liquidity over the next 12-18 months to address total cash needs including remaining debt maturities in 2022 and 2023.,1
Moody's believes T-Mobile's remaining business and integration plan is adequately funded for aggregated costs to achieve synergies and effect full and final integration of networks and operations.,1
"For 2022, we expect the company to generate free cash flow (Moody's adjusted) of around $5.3 billion.",1
"Moody's free cash flow calculation is before spectrum investments, which we treat as a cash outflow within other investing activities on an industry basis and which can place some strain on overall liquidity when spectrum becomes broadly available in the industry.",1
T-Mobile also uses accounts receivable securitizations to manage the working capital swings associated with device financing plans.,0
"Moody's expects the company to extend and likely increase the size of these facilities as necessary, but if unsuccessful this could be a call on cash of up to around $2 billion.",1
"At all times, the senior unsecured notes issued by Sprint and Sprint's wholly-owned subsidiaries, SC and Sprint Capital Corporation (SCC), will continue to receive downstream senior unsecured guarantees from T-Mobile US and T-Mobile.",0
"The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation for T-Mobile's continued subscriber and service revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion, debt leverage (Moody's adjusted) declining steadily towards and sustained around 3.75x and rising free cash flow.",1
"The ratings could be downgraded if T-Mobile's debt/EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) was expected to be sustained above 4x, including as a result of additional debt-funded investments, or if free cash flow was to turn negative for an extended period of time.",1
"With headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) provides mobile communications services under the T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile brands in the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.",0
"Deutsche Telekom AG owns an approximate 48.3% stake in T-Mobile's parent, T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile US), but consolidates the T-Mobile parent and subsidiaries by virtue of its voting control over approximately 51.8% of T-Mobile US.",0

"New York, August 16, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") affirmed TGP Holdings III LLC's (Traeger) ratings including its Corporate Family Rating (CFR) at B3, Probability of Default Rating (PDR) at B3-PD, and the B3 rating of the company's senior secured first lien credit facility.",1
Moody's downgraded the company's Speculative Grade Liquidity rating to SGL-3 from SGL-2 and the outlook is negative.,1
"Traeger also expects its company-adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2022 at $35 - $45 million, or a year-over-year decline of -58% to -68%.",0
"Traeger is experiencing significantly lower consumer demand for its grill products, particularly at price points below $1,000.",0
Ongoing inflationary pressures on consumer spending along with a shift in spending towards categories such as travel is negatively impacting retail traffic and demand for outdoor grills.,0
"As a result of the meaningfully lower revenue and EBITDA expectations, Moody's projects Traeger's credit metrics will materially deteriorate in fiscal 2022 and into fiscal 2023, with debt/EBITDA expected to increase to 15x.",1
"Given the lower revenue expectations Traeger implemented several cost savings initiatives, including workforce reduction and expense control.",0
"Traeger is also working to reduce its grill inventory levels both on hand and in the retail channel, and is materially lowering production volumes in its Asian manufacturing facilities and its suspending its plan for production in Mexico.",0
Moody's expects the shift in consumer spending from goods to services and from discretionary to non-discretionary to persist into 2023 and make it difficult for the company to meaningfully improve operating performance.,1
The downgrade of Traeger's Speculative Grade Liquidity to SGL-3 reflects Moody's expectation for negative free cash flows in fiscal 2022 due to lower earnings and higher than normal inventory levels at year end 2022.,1
"The discretionary nature of outdoor grills and Traeger's relatively expensive grills and accessories products, exposes the company to cyclical changes in consumer discretionary spending.",0
Moody's expects these pressures to persist into 2023.,1
"Traeger's rating also reflects its solid market position within the niche wood pellet grill industry, and its strong brand image supported by its good track record of product innovation.",0
"The company's Speculative Grade Liquidity of SGL-3 reflects Moody's view that the company will maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12 months, supported by a mostly undrawn mostly undrawn $125 million revolving facility, which provides financial flexibility to fund seasonal investments in working capital.",1
Traeger's relies on raw materials primarily steel as part of the manufacturing process of its products.,0
"Traeger is highly exposed to governance risks mainly driven by its concentrated ownership by private equity sponsors, and the company's financial strategy that includes operating with high leverage.",0
"Moody's expects financial policies to be somewhat less aggressive following the IPO including proceeds used to reduce debt, but leverage remains high given the company's reliance on cyclical discretionary consumer spending.",1
Concentrated decision making under private equity control creates potential for event risk and decisions that favor shareholders over creditors.,0
A ratings upgrade would also require the company maintaining at least good liquidity and Moody's expectations of balanced financial policies that sustains credit metrics at the above levels.,1
Traeger reported revenue of $760.9 million for the twelve month period ending 30 June 2022 and its largest market is North America (94% of fiscal 2021 sales).,0
"Traeger, Inc. is the indirect parent of TGP Holdings III LLC, and its common stock is listed under the ticker symbol ""COOK"".",0

"Paris, August 05, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has today changed the outlook on the Government of Italy to negative from stable and affirmed the local- and foreign-currency long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings at Baa3.",1
"Finally, the rating reflects Moody's assumption that core euro area countries will support Italy in case of need, a view that has been confirmed by the European Central Bank's (ECB) recent announcement of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI).",1
"For euro-area countries, a six-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and the local currency rating as well as a zero-notch gap between the local-currency ceiling and foreign-currency ceiling is typical, reflecting benefits from the euro area's strong common institutional, legal and regulatory framework, as well as liquidity support and other crisis management mechanisms.",0
It is also in line with Moody's view of de minimis exit risk from the euro area.,1

"However, the early elections are likely to delay the achievement of some milestones and targets that were due by the end of 2022; these achievements are needed to unlock access to the next installment of NGEU funding, which totals ?19 billion (1.0% of GDP).",0
Italy has strong incentives to comply with the terms of the NRRP because it only receives investment funds in exchange for reforms.,0
"While these incentives are clear, a future government may try to test the willingness of the European Commission and ECB to strictly enforce this conditionality.",0
"The outgoing government had taken a number of measures to reduce gas consumption and diversify supplies, having stated that Italy's reliance on Russia had been cut to around 25% from 40% of total imports.",0
Italy also has domestic gas production and renewable energy potential that could be increased in the coming years.,0
There could also be second-round effects from Italy's reliance on gas for electricity generation.,0
Moody's forecasts debt-to-GDP to stand at 145% down from 151% in 2021 but about 11 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.,1
A positive differential between nominal growth and interest rates is key to Moody's baseline and the debt trajectory is vulnerable to shocks.,1
"Significantly weaker economic growth or a more rapid increase in Italy's borrowing costs would likely challenge debt sustainability if, as Moody's expects, Italy continues to run primary deficits until at least 2024.",1
"According to the Italian fiscal council, every 1 percentage point increase in inflation adds ?1.8 billion (0.1% of GDP) in interest costs while a 100-bps upward shift in the yield curve adds ?2.5 billion in the first year (0.1% of GDP).",0
"In Moody's base case, debt affordability will deteriorate gradually through the forecast period, with interest costs reaching a still-manageable 8.1% of revenue by 2025.",1
Moody's does not expect the recently announced TPI will be a panacea against rising yields in all circumstances.,1
"While the ECB's Governing Council has a lot of discretion over the activation of the tool, its aim is to counter a deterioration in financing conditions that is not warranted by country-specific fundamentals.",0
Some parties are advocating for tax cuts and social benefit hikes that would be politically difficult to reverse.,0
Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro area and its bond market is the largest in the monetary union.,0
Italy's E issuer profile score is moderately negative (E-3).,1
"Italy has low exposure to environmental risks across most categories, though the country has a moderate exposure to physical climate risk, in particular water and heat stress as well as wildfires.",0
Italy is among the most exposed to heat stress in Southern Europe according to Moody's climate risk data.,1
"Moody's assesses Italy's S issuer profile score as highly negative (S-4), mainly due to high demographic risks as well as risks related to labour and income.",1
Italy has one of the oldest populations already now and public social spending is heavily geared towards pensions.,0
"Exposure to other social risks such as housing, health and safety issues and access to basic services is low.",0
"Fiscal transparency and planning is good, with Italy benefitting from European fiscal rules and the credibility of the European Central Bank.",0

"Toronto, July 29, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed all of Strathcona Resources Ltd.'s (Strathcona) ratings, including its B2 corporate family rating (CFR), its B2-PD probability of default rating, and the B3 rating on its senior unsecured notes.",1
"On July 27, 2022, Strathcona entered into an agreement with Serafina Energy Ltd. (Serafina) to acquire all the outstanding shares of Serafina for cash consideration of C$2.3 billion.",0
"Serafina is an exploration and production company that produces about 40,000 bbls/d (before royalties) primarily through thermal heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan.",0
"""The affirmation and maintenance of the positive outlook reflects Strathcona's sizable production and reserve base pro forma for the complimentary Serafina acquisition,"" said Moody's analyst Paresh Chari.",1
"Proforma for the Serafina acquisition and new debt instruments, Moody's expects minimal cash and about C$200 million of availability under its C$2 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in February 2026).",1
Moody's expects about $450 million of free cash flow through to mid-2023 using Moody's medium term price assumptions and much higher if current market prices were to persist.,1
Strathcona will also need to fund the deferred payments of C$400 million from September to December 2022 which Moody's expects will be funded using revolver availability and free cash flow.,1
"Strathcona's new term loan is subject to a cash flow sweep provision that sweeps 100% of free cash flow until the term loan balance falls by 50%, and then the cash flow sweep declines to 50%.",0
Moody's expects Strathcona will be in compliance with its three financial covenants through to mid-2023.,1
Moody's Loss Given Default for Speculative-Grade Companies (LGD) methodology suggests that the notes be ranked two notches below Strathcona's B2 CFR due to the size and priority ranking of the company's C$2 billion first lien revolver and C$700 million first lien term loan due 2024 (revolver and term loan are pari passu) relative to the unsecured US$500 million notes due 2026 in the company's capital structure.,1
"However, given the positive outlook on Strathcona's CFR, strong asset coverage, Moody's views the assigned B3 rating as more appropriate.",1
The positive outlook is supported by Moody's expectation that Strathcona's credit metrics and liquidity will improve with debt reduction funded by free cash flow and that production will modestly grow over the next 12 to 18 months.,1
Strathcona is majority owned by private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund.,0

"Hong Kong, August 01, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR) to Sino-Ocean Group Holding Limited (Sino-Ocean) and has withdrawn the company's Baa3 issuer rating.",1
"At the same time, Moody's has downgraded (1) to Ba1 from Baa3, the senior unsecured ratings on the bonds issued by Sino-Ocean Land Treasure Finance I Limited, Sino-Ocean Land Treasure Finance II Limited and Sino-Ocean Land Treasure IV Limited, and guaranteed by Sino-Ocean; and (2) to Ba3 from Ba2, the rating on the subordinated, guaranteed perpetual capital securities issued by Sino-Ocean Land Treasure III Limited and guaranteed on a subordinated basis by Sino-Ocean.",1
Moody's has also changed the rating outlook on Sino-Ocean and its subsidiaries to negative from ratings under review.,1
"""The rating downgrades reflect our expectation that support from China Life Insurance Co Ltd (China Life, insurance financial strength rating A1 stable), Sino-Ocean's largest shareholder, will reduce over time, as the deterioration in China's property market would reduce Sino-Ocean's economic and strategic importance to China Life,"" says Cedric Lai, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.",1
The expectation of lower support results in a reduction of the rating uplift from China Life to one notch from two notches previously.,0
The support assumption has considered that Sino-Ocean remains an important equity investment of China Life in the real estate sector.,0
"However, Moody's expects the importance of real estate investment as an asset class for China Life would reduce over the next 12-18 months given the sector's high volatility.",1
"Sino-Ocean's standalone credit strength reflects its long operating history in the property sector, focus on operating in high-tier Chinese cities, solid access to funding and diversified products, and its recurring income contribution from its investment property portfolio.",0
Moody's expects Sino-Ocean's operating performance to weaken over the next 12-18 months amid difficult operating and funding conditions in China.,1
"Specifically, Moody's forecasts Sino-Ocean's contracted sales will decline around 25% to around RMB100 billion in 2022, from around RMB136 billion in 2021 due in part to a higher base in the second half of last year.",1
"Moody's expects Sino Ocean's gross margin to reduce to around 16%-17% over the next 12-18 months from 19% in 2021, as the company will likely offer certain price discounts to support its contracted sales amid the difficult market conditions.",1
"Moody's forecasts the company's debt leverage, as measured by revenue/adjusted debt, will weaken to around 55%-60% over the next 12-18 months from 68% in 2021.",1
These forecasts incorporate Moody's expectation of the company's higher debt and gross profit margin decline.,1
Moody's expects Sino-Ocean to maintain good liquidity.,1
Sino-Ocean's senior unsecured bond rating is not affected by subordination to claims at the operating company level.,0
"Despite Sino-Ocean's status as a holding company, Moody's expects support from China Life to Sino-Ocean to flow through the holding company rather than directly to its main operating companies, mitigating potential differences in expected losses that could arise from structural subordination.",1
"In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, Moody's has considered the company's (1) strong shareholders and representation on its board of directors; (2) disclosure of material related-party transactions as required by the Corporate Governance Code for companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; and (3) diversified board of directors and four special committees to supervise the company's operations.",1
"Moody's could also downgrade the ratings without a decline in the company's standalone credit profile, if Moody's further lowers its assessment of support from China Life for Sino-Ocean.",1
"An upgrade of Sino-Ocean's ratings is unlikely over the next 12 months, given the negative outlook.",0
"However, Moody's could revise the outlook to stable if (1) Sino-Ocean demonstrates resilience amid difficult operating conditions through stabilizing its business performance, maintaining its good liquidity and funding assess, as well as disciplined financial management; and (2) China Life continues to provide operational and financial support to Sino-Ocean, in times of need.",1

"New York, May 26, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has today affirmed the long-term foreign- and local-currency issuer ratings of the Government of Egypt at B2 and changed the outlook to negative from stable.",1
"Moody's has also affirmed Egypt's foreign-currency senior unsecured ratings at B2, and its foreign-currency senior unsecured MTN program rating at (P)B2.",1
"While the economy's external position remains supported by significant financial commitments pledged by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil-exporting sovereigns and the prospect of a new IMF program, tightening global financing conditions increase the risk of weaker recurrent inflows than Moody's currently anticipates to shore up Egypt's external position.",1
"Susceptibility to event risks is broad-based and includes political risk, especially in the context of a sharp increase in food price inflation which, if not mitigated, could raise social tensions according to Moody's assessment of the relevance of social risks for sovereign credit; while rising domestic borrowing costs, if sustained, will exacerbate liquidity risks and debt affordability challenges, both long-standing weaknesses of Egypt's credit profile.",1
Egypt's broad and dedicated domestic funding base helps weather tightening financing conditions.,0
"The LC ceiling at Ba2, three notches above the sovereign rating, acknowledges the public sector's large footprint in the economy that inhibits private sector development and credit allocation, mitigated by a growing track record of implementation of structural competitiveness reforms.",0
"The FC ceiling at Ba3, one notch below the LC ceiling, reflects the progressive removal of remaining barriers to capital in- and outflows and a more flexible exchange rate which in Moody's view signal a low risk of transfer and convertibility restrictions, notwithstanding the tighter foreign currency liquidity environment.",1
Please click on this link https://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_ARFTL466319 for the List of Affected Credit Ratings.,1
"In contrast to previous instances of sharp capital outflows driven by external shocks such as in the second half of 2018 or at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the most recent external shock has materialized when the economy's liquid foreign exchange reserve buffer at $29.3 billion in April [1] was already weakened by the pandemic and higher imports to fuel the recovery.",0
"In Moody's assessment, the coverage of this net liability position with foreign exchange reserves to buttress banks' counterparty risk standing reduces the amount of usable reserves to meet renewed external shocks.",1
"However, in Moody's assessment continued foreign exchange reserve coverage of upcoming external debt service payments over the next three years at about $25-30 billion (including short-term plus medium/long-term external debt maturities) will depend on continued inflows from abroad.",1
"While Moody's expects the government's privatization strategy aiming for $10 billion in FDI inflows annually over four years to help bolster Egypt's FX reserve buffer in the future, the likelihood of renewed large-scale inflows is low in the near future in Moody's assessment, raising downside risks.",1
"Egypt's debt affordability as measured by general government interest/revenue Moody's estimates at over 45% and interest/GDP at about 9% in fiscal 2022 is very weak globally, exposing fiscal accounts to tightening borrowing costs.",1
"Over the past two months the central bank of Egypt has raised the monetary policy rate by a cumulative 300 basis points in response to surging inflation at 13.1% year over year in April [2], driven by the fallout from pandemic-related supply disruptions, soaring global food and energy prices, and the repercussion of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound by about 14% in March.",0
"While Moody's projects the central bank's monetary policy actions to keep inflation expectations in check thereby contributing to a stabilization and eventual improvement in debt affordability, over time, the larger interest bill crowds out other spending for social, investment or security purposes.",1
"Combined with the negative impact of inflation on living standards - food accounts for more than 30% of the consumption basket -, this points to potentially increasing social risks in Moody's assessment.",1
"The track record of improved policy effectiveness supports the government's structural economic reform agenda to enhance export competitiveness, broaden the revenue base, and a shift to targeted income support measures as well as the maintenance of primary surpluses underpinning Moody's expectation of a renewed reduction in the debt/GDP ratio starting fiscal 2023.",1
"Despite the larger interest bill, Moody's projects the general government debt ratio to resume its downward trajectory toward 85% of GDP in 2025, after a renewed increase to 93.5% of GDP in fiscal 2022 as a result of the valuation effect from the currency depreciation.",1
"The Nile's flow has been affected by the decreasing rate of annual rainwater, leading to very high fresh water resource depletion rates which the government seeks to address via the installation of desalination plants and the application of strict rules for the cultivation of water-intensive crops such as rice and sugarcane.",0
Relatively high poverty rates and gender inequality also contribute to social risks which have been exacerbated by the large economic reform adjustment costs borne by consumers over the past few years.,0
Evidence of a renewed build-up in the monetary system's net foreign asset position that is likely to be sustained and a strengthening foreign exchange reserve buffer to meet external debt service payments and commensurate with Egypt's adopted economic model based on an open capital account and relative exchange rate stability would likely lead Moody's to stabilize the outlook.,1

"Supply chain and operational challenges are expected to continue to constrain inventory levels leading to further market share erosion as inflation in food and energy costs weigh on discretionary income,"" said Christina Boni, Moody's Senior Vice President.",1
The downgrade to SGL-2 reflects that free cash flow is expected to be negative in fiscal 2022 and its $1 billion revolver will be utilized seasonally.,0
"Nonetheless, Bed Bath has been successful in growing its e-commerce business significantly to approximately 37% of its overall sales.",0
Bed Bath has worked to rationalize its banners as well as its store base with a total of 63 completed in fiscal 2021.,0
Moody's expects share repurchases will not be resumed until operational performance returns to more historical levels.,1
Bed Bath has also continued to make strategic capital expenditures and is expected to spend $400 million in fiscal 2022.,0
The outlook reflects Moody's view that further shareholder returns before profitability consistently improves would be viewed as aggressive.,1

"New York, May 04, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has today downgraded the Government of El Salvador's long-term foreign-currency issuer rating and long-term foreign-currency senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa3 from Caa1.",1
The outlook is negative.,1
"Moody's decision to downgrade El Salvador's ratings reflects an increased probability of a credit event  restructuring, distressed exchange, or default  with relatively high severity, as the sovereign faces a challenging debt amortization schedule with bond maturities in 2023 and 2025 in a context of continued funding stress and persistently high financing needs.",1
The negative outlook on the Caa3 rating reflects Moody's view that in the event of a default losses to investors could exceed those typically associated with a Caa3 rating.,1
"Concurrently, Moody's has lowered El Salvador's foreign-currency country ceiling to Caa1 from B2, maintaining the existing two-notch gap between the sovereign rating and the foreign-currency ceiling to reflect the low predictability of institutions and government policies, weak policy effectiveness and the government's relatively large share in the country's total external debt.",1
The downgrade incorporates Moody's expectation of high material losses to investors ahead of the two upcoming bond redemptions.,1
"Even if the government finds a way to manage near-term financing pressures from the upcoming 2023 bond maturity, Moody's view is that the sovereign will continue to face funding pressures that would compromise its ability to service its debt commitments in full.",1
"Although the sovereign's liquidity pressures have eased somewhat as a result of last year's record-high 26.9% increase in tax receipts, Moody's believes that liquidity pressures will intensify in the second half of 2022 and through the upcoming $800 million bond maturity in January 2023.",1
Moody's estimates indicate that El Salvador will likely face a funding gap of about 1% of GDP this year as the government moves to cover financing needs equivalent to 16.2% of GDP.,1
"The government has announced its intention to reform the pension system, which Moody's thinks could free up liquidity to meet the 2023 bond payment.",1
The ratio of interest payments-to-revenue reached 18.4% in 2021 and Moody's forecasts it will remain above 18% through 2024.,1
"El Salvador's geography is dominated by a region known as the Dry Corridor, characterized by heavy precipitation events that lead to flooding and landslides and occasional droughts.",0
"Extreme weather events can lead to volatility in some of El Salvador's key credit metrics, including GDP growth, household incomes and agricultural export earnings.",0
"While remittances from El Salvadorans living abroad support about 25% of economic activity, which boosts consumption, high levels of violence and insecurity stunt the country's investment levels, productivity and long-term growth potential.",0

"New York, July 11, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded Petroleos Mexicanos' (PEMEX) corporate family rating and the senior unsecured ratings on the company's existing notes, as well as the ratings based on PEMEX's guarantee, to B1 from Ba3.",1
"Moody's also affirmed PEMEX's Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA), which reflects its standalone credit strength, at caa3.",1
"These rating actions were triggered by Moody's announcement on July 8, 2022 that it had downgraded its ratings on the Government of Mexico's to Baa2 from Baa1 and changed the outlook on the government's ratings to stable from negative.",1
The outlook on Pemex's ratings is now stable.,0
"The action also considered PEMEX's high debt maturities in 2022-24 and Moody's expectations for continued negative free cash flow and the need for large amounts of external funding given persistent loses at the company's refining business, the necessity to maintain capex at least at current levels to sustain production and reserves stable, and high interest expenses.",1
Elevated oil prices in 2022-23 in comparison with 2020-21 levels will support higher cash generation at PEMEX's exploration and production (E&P) business in the period but will simultaneously increase royalties and operating costs at the refining business.,0
"However, Moody's estimates that, in 2022-24, the company will only be able to sustain production and reserves at current levels given its inability to invest larger sums of capital in E&P.",1
"PEMEX's B1 rating takes into consideration Moody's joint default analysis, which includes the rating agency's assumptions of very high government support in case of need and very high default correlation between PEMEX and the Government of Mexico, resulting in five notches of uplift from the company's caa3 BCA.",1
"Since 2016, and most importantly and increasingly from 2019 to 2021, the government has supported PEMEX in various ways, including capital injections, tax reductions, and early redemption of notes receivable from the government.",0
"Moody's assumes that the government, as promised, will continue to fund PEMEX's cash needs and help the company to comply with its debt amortization obligations of $5.1 billion in 2022, $7.5 billion in 2023, and $8.9 billion in 2024, as of March 2022.",1
"In addition, Moody's estimates that PEMEX will have substantial negative free cash flow in the next 12-18 months, driven by insufficient operating cash generation to pay interest expenses, taxes, and capital spending.",1
The stable outlook on PEMEX's ratings is based on Moody's expectation that the company's business strategy and financial profile will remain unchanged in the next 12-18 months; it also considers the current stable outlook on Mexico's ratings.,1
"Because PEMEX's rating is highly dependent on support from the Government of Mexico, a change in Moody's assumptions about government support and its timeliness could lead to a downgrade of PEMEX's rating.",1
A lowering of the BCA could also lead to a downgrade of PEMEX's rating.,0
"In addition, factors that could lead to a higher BCA and potentially a higher rating for PEMEX would include its ability to strengthen its liquidity position and internally fund sufficient capital reinvestment to fully replace reserves, deliver modest production growth and generate free cash flow for debt reduction.",0
"PEMEX has a very highly negative exposure to environmental risk (E-5 Issuer Profile Score) mainly driven by very high carbon transition risk, high natural capital risk, high water management risk, and high waste and pollution risk.",0

"New York, May 31, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") upgraded Range Resources Corporation's (Range) Corporate Family Rating (CFR) to Ba2 from Ba3, Probability of Default Rating (PDR) to Ba2-PD from Ba3-PD, and senior unsecured notes to Ba3 from B1.",1
The rating outlook was changed to stable from positive.,1
"""The upgrade reflects improved credit metrics for Range, and our expectation of continued debt reduction using the meaningful free cash flow the company will generate,"" said Arvinder Saluja, Moody's Vice President.",1
"""Range has continued to focus on maintaining capital discipline despite higher natural gas and NGLs prices, and has made public commitments to prioritize further deleveraging.""",0
Range's low-cost structure and capital discipline will help the company generate sizeable free cash flow in an improved commodity price backdrop for both natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).,0
Moody's expects Range to continue to optimize its operating and development costs.,1
"In addition, Range benefits from long-lived reserves, conservative financial policies, and a high level of operational control over its reserves, enabling significant discipline over the pace of future development.",0
"While financial performance of Range will continue to be influenced by industry cycles, compared to historical experience Moody's expects future profitability and cash flow in this sector to be less robust at the cycle peak and worse at the cycle trough because global initiatives to limit adverse impacts of climate change will constrain the use of hydrocarbons and accelerate the shift to less environmentally damaging energy sources.",1
"Moody's expects Range to have very good liquidity in 2022-23 as reflected by the SGL-1 Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating, underpinned by positive free cash flow generation even at mid-cycle natural gas and NGL prices.",1
"In April, Range amended its revolving bank facility and downsized its revolver to $1.5 billion with a new maturity date of April 2027, giving it pro forma borrowing capacity of just under $1.2 billion.",0
Moody's expects Range to maintain ample cushion under its financial covenants.,1
"Range's senior unsecured notes are rated Ba3, one notch below the assigned Ba2 CFR, due to their structural subordination to the company's $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility.",1
