Asset Sale,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/08/04/lordstown-motors-foxconn-profit/,Lordstown Motors reports first quarterly profit on asset sale to Foxconn,"Lordstown Motors Corp on Thursday reported its first quarterly profit as the electric-vehicle firm benefited from the sale of certain assets including its Ohio assembly line to Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn.The companys shares rose 4.8% in premarket trading as it also lowered its expected capital needs for the year to between $50 million and $75 million from about $150 million, citing lower expenses.The EV company recorded a gain of more than $100 million in the April-June quarter from the Ohio asset sale, which was prompted by the need for funding amid industry-wide supply chain disruptions and rising material costs.That helped it post a net income of $63.7 million, compared with a loss of $108.2 million a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company posted a loss of 19 cents per share that was narrower than analysts average estimate of a 45 cents per share loss, according to Refinitiv data.(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni)Related video:"

Asset Sale,https://fortune.com/2020/03/23/softbank-41-billion-asset-sale-credit-rout-critics/,SoftBank announces $41 billion asset sale to face coronavirus rout—and silence critics,"Masayoshi Son is making his biggest play yet to silence doubters. On Monday, the Japanese billionaire unveiled an unprecedented $41 billion plan to sell off assets and shore up SoftBank Group Corp.’s crumbling market value in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.SoftBank aims to sell assets to raise as much as 4.5 trillion yen ($41 billion) over the coming year to buy back stock and slash debt — an amount equivalent to almost its entire market value last week. The scale of the endeavor surprised investors, sending the Japanese firm’s stock up 19%. Yet that’s a fraction of the capitalization the investment house has lost since its 2020 peak, underscoring persistent concerns that tumbling technology sector valuations will damage Son’s debt-laden company.The Japanese conglomerate, which also operates the $100 billion Vision Fund, is considered especially vulnerable to economic shocks given its enormous debt load and ties to unprofitable startups across the world. After Monday’s rally, it’s still down more than 40% from this year’s peak in February.The coronavirus-triggered rout has also spread to credit markets and sparked a surge in the cost of insuring debt against default — including that of SoftBank, whose credit-default swaps touched their highest level in about a decade.Monday’s announcement appeared intended to underscore a point Son himself has made repeatedly: that SoftBank is worth far more than its current stock price thanks to holdings in industry leaders from e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to British chip designer Arm Holdings Plc and Japanese carrier arm SoftBank Corp. Its slice of Alibaba alone is worth more than $120 billion.“Son is finally doing what his investors have been asking for years and unfortunately it took an unprecedented sequence of events for him to do so,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “His Vision Fund ambition will have to take a backseat for now, but he will be back.”It’s unclear what SoftBank intends to sell, however. Alibaba represents its single biggest chunk of unrealized value, but Arm — which SoftBank bought for $32 billion in 2016 — is a worldwide leader in the chip architecture that underpins modern smartphones. SoftBank Corp., on the other hand, is a steady if unspectacular leader that generates cash to help fund Son’s global ambitions, and the group likes to use its stock as collateral for loans.“Arm is a golden egg for SoftBank, and the business will attract U.S. firms like Intel once it starts a bidding process,” said Koji Hirai, the head of M&A at advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.Part of the sale proceeds would go toward a new share buyback program of as much as 2 trillion yen that comes on top of previously announced repurchases. Alibaba’s stock was down more than 5% in the afternoon in Hong Kong. The Japanese firm’s domestic telecom arm, ended 3.4% lower. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment on whether it would sell shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant.“There is institutional memory at SoftBank of these kinds of shocks, first dating back to the dot-com bubble,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings who writes for Smartkarma. “There is no doubt that there will be much more bad news coming from the Vision Fund, bankruptcies and falling valuations. This is one way SoftBank can get ahead of that.”Son is trying to salvage his reputation as one of the world’s foremost tech investors, a name based largely on a prescient early bet on Alibaba, which grew to dominate e-commerce in the world’s No. 2 economy. But he’s struggled since to match that success, after sinking money into a string of struggling startups from Uber Technologies Inc. to WeWork and Oyo Hotels.Even before the global outbreak, WeWork’s spectacular implosion served as a catalyst for Son to temper SoftBank’s and the Vision Fund’s aggressive global bets. He urged founders to rein in excesses and focus on the bottom line, wary of a repeat of WeWork’s uninhibited expansion.Son has reason to worry. SoftBank’s exposure to cash-burning startups partly prompted S&P Global Ratings to cut its outlook on SoftBank to negative, citing also the broader market declines and the conglomerate’s initial plans for a buyback. The stock repurchase program announced Monday comes on top of a 500 billion yen plan announced just over a week ago, after activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp. called on the Japanese investment firm to boost returns.SoftBank has said its financial policy is to have enough liquidity on hand to cover two years of bond repayments and focus on its loan-to-value ratio, a metric for balancing net interest-bearing debt against the value of investments. SoftBank has also said it’s curbing new investments to match the current environment and acknowledged that fundraising costs are likely to rise.It keeps a running tally of what it calculates is the value of its shares, excluding its debt. Despite Monday’s rally, that figure remains more than three times its closing price of 3,187 yen.While SoftBank’s newly unveiled asset sale and buyback plan would go some way toward assuaging concerns about its situation, the big question remains the spread of Covid-19 and its ultimate impact on both investment activity and the broader economy.“SoftBank is now trying to sell its assets as the values for those are cheap,” said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Japan. “Investment companies are supposed to purchase assets when they are cheap and sell them when they are expensive. It looks like SoftBank is doing the opposite, when they have to invest more money.”More must-read stories from Fortune:—This famed economist doesn’t think we’re headed for another Great Recession—These estimates of how much COVID-19 will hurt the economy are terrifying—With the markets in turmoil, the ECB readies a bond-buying bazooka—Here’s where Goldman Sachs predicts the stock market will bottom out—Listen to Leadership Next, a Fortune podcast examining the evolving role of CEO—WATCH: What’s causing the looming recessionSubscribe to Fortune’s Bull Sheet for no-nonsense finance news and analysis daily."

REUTERS/File Photo/File PhotoBut with the outlook for oil and gas prices uncertain because of the coronavirus pandemic and a shift to cleaner energy, finding buyers and striking deals might prove tricky.“This is not a very good time to sell assets,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said while presenting the French giant’s strategy to switch to renewables on Wednesday.Eight of the worlds top oil companies, Exxon Mobil XOM.N, Chevron CVX.N, Royal Dutch ShellRDSa.L, BPBP.L, Total TOTF.PA, Equinor EQNR.OL, Eni ENI.MI and ConocoPhillips COP.N, are expected to sell assets with resources of around 68 billion barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent.Those assets today carry an estimated value of $111 billion, and are equivalent to around two years of existing global oil demand, Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy said in a note.(Graphic: )Oil prices hit their lowest since 1999 in April after a collapse in demand caused by coronavirus-related travel restrictions. They have since recovered to around $40 a barrel, but are not expected to rise dramatically in coming years.This means an opportunity to snap up cheap assets for smaller companies like Serica Energy SQZ.L, Cairn Energy CNE.L and Jadestone Energy M4E.BE, Peel Hunt analysts said.Yet with a narrowing pool of buyers and a growing reluctance to lend to the oil and gas sector, disposals could be tough.""Oil and gas asset sales will of course put pressure on market pricing if there are few buyers for these assets,"" Garrett Soden, CEO of Canadian-listed Africa Energy AFE.V, which is part of Lundin Group, said.Reduced investments by the majors could however lead to tighter supply and higher oil prices, which would increase the value of their resources, Soden added.The majors need to sell assets to boost revenues and reduce debt amassed in the wake of the oil price collapse.European companies including BP, Shell and Total are also looking to focus their oil and gas operations on the most profitable and least polluting projects after pledging to slash carbon emissions in coming decades.Exxon and BP each hope to sell $25 billion of assets in the coming years, while Shell aims to dispose of $5 billion a year.Spiro Youakim, global head of natural resources at investment bank Lazard, told Reuters that oil company boards should consider spinning off unwanted oil and gas production and refining businesses to attract new investors as buyers such as private equity lose appetite.“The majors’ portfolios are exceedingly large and they include more peripheral assets which could be run more effectively by different types of investors,” Youakim said."

This builds on its existing portfolio of 750,000 net acres in the Permian.U.S. shale producers have used mergers and acquisitions to boost their size to compete against the largest operators and lower production costs through economies of scale.To help pay for the deal, ConocoPhillips will hike its own divestment targets by 2023 to between $4 billion and $5 billion, up from between $2 billion and $3 billion.VALUEFor Shell, selling the Permian assets will leave its U.S. oil and gas production almost entirely in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, where it is the largest single producer. It sold its Appalachian gas assets last year.The sale was announced on the same day Shell disclosed damage to offshore transfer facilities from Hurricane Ida will cut production from the area into early next year. read more""We have had a once in a 20-30 year storm that has been impactful, but we continue to believe this is a very valuable position,"" Wael Sawan, the companys director of upstream, told Reuters.Sawan said the company would continue to invest in its top oil and gas assets globally, and while it had looked at options which would have retained and boosted its Permian acreage in recent years, it was decided the position did not have sufficient scale for Shell to continue to operate it.""This sale came up for us as a very compelling value proposition,"" Sawan said.U.S. will continue to account for around one-third of Shells global spending, as it focuses on its Gulf position as well as petrochemicals and renewables.Shell will return $7 billion of the proceeds to shareholders as dividends on top of existing commitments, with the rest going to pay down debt, it said. Conoco also announced it would increase quarterly cash payments to shareholders by 7% from Dec. 1.Reuters first reported in June that Shell had put up for sale its assets in the Permian, the shale formation stretching across Texas and New Mexico that accounts for around 40% of U.S. oil production.Morgan Stanley and Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co advised Shell, with Goldman Sachs supporting ConocoPhillips.

Investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the mining company to jettison the onshore assets for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August.The sale price was better than the $8 billion to $10 billion that analysts had expected, and investors were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders.“It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,” said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund.BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp at the peak of the oil boom. It spent a further $20 billion developing the assets, but suffered as gas and oil prices collapsed, triggering massive writedowns.The world’s biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results.FILE PHOTO: BHP Billiton Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie is silhouetted against a screen projecting the companys logo at a round table meeting with journalists in Tokyo, Japan June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoU.S. BOOST FOR BPThe deal, BP’s biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent.BP will acquire BHP’s unit holding Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian Basin shale assets for $10.5 billion, giving it “some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,” the company said.(For a graphic on U.S. oil production, click: tmsnrt.rs/2K1EjdY)Its bid beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Chevron Corp CVX.N for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources.The acquisition could push BP’s total U.S. production to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in two years and close to 1.4 million boe/d by 2025, said Maxim Petrov, a Wood Mackenzie analyst.“The Permian acreage offers the biggest longer-term upside, with some of the best breakevens in the play, well below $50 per barrel,” said Petrov.The deal would turn the onshore United States into “a heartland business in the company,” Bernard Looney, BP’s head of upstream, said in a call with analysts.It will bring BP into the oil-rich Permian basin in West Texas, where production has surged in recent years. With it, BP’s onshore oil production will jump from 10,000 barrels per day to 200,000 bpd by the mid-2020s, Looney said.BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range.The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters.Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion.Tribeca’s Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility.“It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,” he said.BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio.BHP BHP.AX shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market .AXJO and rival Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L.BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in installments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.An Elliott spokesman declined to comment."

REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe bank said on Wednesday it expects to close the sale of the Columbia Managements long-term asset management business to Ameriprise Financial Inc AMP.N next spring for between $900 million and $1.2 billion in cash.The business duplicates similar operations at newly-acquired Merrill Lynch.“When you’ve got the 64,000 pound gorilla, in the case of Merrill Lynch’s asset management business, you don’t need the Chihuahua,” said Tony Plath, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte banking professor.The deal is a sign of the times for financial services transactions, analysts said.While in line with other, recent asset manager sales, the price was far below the premiums seen during the economic boom, analysts said.In buying much of Columbia, Ameriprise is paying about 7 times the expected earnings of the unit before interest, taxes and depreciation, a company spokesman said.That is well below the historic average of about 11 percent for deals in the asset-management industry, according to data from Jefferies Putnam Lovell, the investment banking arm of Jefferies & Co.The deal will push Ameriprise above $400 billion in assets under management, making it the eighth-largest U.S. mutual fund manager with a global presence, its Chief Executive Jim Cracchiolo said.Ameriprise had $165 billion in equity and fixed income assets under management at the end of June.OTHER SALES AHEAD?Columbia’s long-term management sale, and potential sales of Columbia’s other units, is unlikely to be a significant gain for Bank of America, Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in a research note.Horowitz estimates Columbia’s short-term asset management unit could return $250 million to $350 million in a separate transaction.Bank of America is also attempting to sell Merrill’s First Republic Bank, according to media reports, the private banking business inherited from January’s merger.Jefferson Harralson, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods banking analyst, said the drawn-out negotiations in the Columbia deal may be a harbinger for any potential sales.“They’ve got the flexibility to take their time and make the right economic decision with these businesses,” he said.The Charlotte, North Carolina-based financial giant announced Columbia’s possible sale as part of a broader capital plan in May, when the results of federal government stress testing for the 19 largest U.S. banks mandated, in many cases, that they raise additional capital.Ameriprise CEO Cracchiolo said Columbia’s sale began in April and was an “auction-type process” involving several rounds of bidding.He said Bank of America initially offered all of Columbia, but backed away from that approach during the bidding, instead resolving to sell only the long-term asset management division.“That’s what we really wanted to complement our business,” Cracchiolo said.A Bank of America spokesman did not dispute Cracchiolo’s description of the bidding process but declined to comment further.Bank of America shares ended down 1.4 percent at $16.92 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ameriprise finished up 12.3 percent, also on the NYSE."

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File PhotoSummarySummary Companies Regulators pressing Huarong to sell units - sourcesDollar bonds rise on news of planned saleHuarongs problems spooked dollar bond investors in AprilBEIJING/HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - China is pushing China Huarong Asset Management Co (2799.HK) to sell non-core assets, two people involved in the revamp told Reuters, while considering offering an implicit guarantee of the liabilities of the debt-laden bad-debt manager.Regulators are pressing the state-controlled ""bad bank"", which has been trying to restructure since 2018, to sell units including a bank, a trust, an investment firm and a consumer finance firm, the sources said.The plan, one source said, envisions the authorities informally backing $20 billion of dollar debt coming due this year for the sprawling company, one of the nations four giant state-owned asset managers.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterNews of the plan lifted dollar bonds issued by Huarong Finance, a subsidiary of the company, to near three-week highs.Huarongs problems spooked investors in Chinas dollar-bond market in April after it delayed its business results, prompting ratings downgrades, warnings from global agencies and an ongoing suspension in share trading. Huarongs onshore and offshore subsidiaries have made timely repayments on maturing debt.""The benefit of bailing out (Huarong) is great,"" the other source said. ""So is the harm of not bailing it out.""The Beijing-based company, established in the late 1990s to handle soured debts at state banks, has the Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder. Former chairman Lai Xiaomin was executed in January after a graft probe into the period when he expanded Huarong into a financial conglomerate.The authorities are considering asking the other state-owned asset managers - China Cinda Asset Management (1359.HK), Great Wall Asset Management and Oriental Asset Management - to undertake similar streamlining after Huarong, the sources said.They asked not to be identified because the information is not public and they are not authorised to speak to the news media.Huarong told Reuters in an emailed statement on Friday that regulators have asked it to ""return to our roots, focus on our main business and build up core competitiveness."" It did not confirm or deny asset sales, saying it would make statements in the future, and did not comment on any debt guarantees.""The company will earnestly fulfill our debt repayment obligations with a responsible attitude,"" Huarong said, ""At the same time, the companys liquidity is in good condition and we have made proper arrangements and adequate preparations for future bond repayment.""The Ministry of Finance and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), Huarongs regulatory supervisor, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The authorities have not made any final decisions on a rescue or on Huarongs long-term business development prospects, the sources said. Regulators are waiting for the final audit results of Huarongs delayed annual report, which could be released in August, before making such decisions, the second source said.The backing for Huarongs debt would not be a public announcement but more informal suasion from the authorities, as sometimes seen in China, to prevent creditors from taking drastic action, the first source said.The CBIRC, for example, previously asked some banks not to withhold loans to Huarong and asked some state banks to be prepared to support it with cash, Reuters reported in April. read moreFollowing Reuters report on Friday, a perpetual bond issued by Huarong Finance added 7.5 cents to trade at 68 cents in the dollar, while other issues maturing in 2029 and 2027 jumped 5 cents and 5.5 cents respectively, according to Refinitiv data.SEEKING BUYERS FROM HUNAN TO GERMANYBeyond any rescue of Huarong, the plan aims to shore up confidence in investment-grade Chinese issuers in the offshore market, the two sources said.Regulators are trying to avoid bankruptcy or ""haircuts"" for investors in Huarongs offshore dollar bonds after the companys difficulties recently sent their prices to record lows, the first source said.The key aim of the current approach is to ensure Huarong can roll over debt and, ideally, use future cash flow to repay its debt, the second source said.The three-year push to streamline Huarong has been slowed by disagreements among the company, its shareholders and regulators, a third source told Reuters.Now, a number of possible asset sales are in the works.The government of central Chinas Hunan province is in talks to take a controlling stake in Changsha-based Huarong Xiangjiang Bank, said the first source.

Its also an area where CNPC has little competitive edge,"" said one of the sources.PetroChina bought Arrow Energy in 2010 for $2.5 billion via a joint-venture with Shell (SHEL.L), in its first investment in Australias coal seam gas sector. It purchased BHPs stake in Browse, Australias largest untapped gas resource, in 2013 for $1.63 billion.The company is also looking to offload the wholly-owned MacKay River Oilsands and Dover Oilsands projects in Canada because of losses producing and processing the tar-like fuel into bitumen, the sources added.PetroChina declined to comment.Chinas state energy companies were among the industrys most acquisitive in the early 2010s, including CNOOCs $15 billion takeover of Canadas Nexen in 2013. But they became more subdued after the 2014/15 oil price collapse and as the government scrutinized their finances.Economic factors have also likely caused PetroChina to question its buying spree.Arrow is PetroChinas largest loss-making overseas investment. Browse is technologically challenging and unlikely to start producing until 2030, if it even receives final approval.Arrow only made a final investment decision to develop the 5-trillion-cubic-feet Surat Gas Project in Queensland in 2020. It was held back by a dispute between PetroChina and Shell over the pricing of gas to a Shell-operated export facility, Reuters has reported.Between 2018-2021, Arrow reported around A$3.3 billion ($2.29 billion) in losses, including A$2.2 billion in impairments.""Investment decisions of our shareholders are a matter for them and Arrow will not comment or speculate,” an Arrow spokesperson said when contacted by Reuters.BROWSEFor Browse, partners including BP (BP.L), Shell and Japan Australia LNG have spent over $100 million on development studies since PetroChina bought into the project, including a plan scrapped in 2016 to set up a $30 billion floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.They are now looking at a $22 billion plan to use the field to feed the Karratha Gas Plant (KGP) in northwestern Australia as that plants original fields dry up.Browse operator Woodside has said the project will only go ahead if the partners can come up with an economically viable carbon capture and storage solution and reach a tolling agreement with the KGP owners.But that lower cost plan doesnt appeal to PetroChina, said one of the sources.""PetroChina foresees great uncertainties ahead, being the smallest stake holder and has little leverage along the value chain as it has no ownership in the downstream KGP plant,"" the source said.OIL SANDSPetroChina paid C$1.9 billion ($1.48 billion) in 2009 for a 60% stake in the Dover and MacKay River projects from Athabasca Oil Corp and then purchased the remaining stakes in the projects for a similar amount over 2012 and 2013.The first phase of the MacKay project started up in 2017 with 35,000 barrels per day (bpd) of bitumen, climbing to a peak of 150,000 bpd, while the Dover site is expected to eventually produce 250,000 bpd of bitumen, according to the PetroChina Canada website.One of the sources familiar with the possible divestment said that PetroChina is displeased with the relatively high production costs of $70 per barrel at the projects and both sites face discontent from local residents over their environmental impact.($1 = 1.4440 Australian dollars)($1 = 1.2838 Canadian dollars)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Chen Aizhu; additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne and David Gaffen in New York; Editing by Christian SchmollingerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Mike BlakeThe divestment would give the Findlay, Ohio-based company a cash boost at a time when a looming economic slowdown triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak and lower oil prices are weighing on its prospects. Marathon’s shares have lost half their value in the last three weeks.Marathon is exploring a sale of MPLX’s gathering and processing (G&P) business, which transports hydrocarbons from drilling sites to major pipelines, the sources said. Intrepid Financial Partners is advising on a sale process for the business, which is at its early stages, the sources added. If there is a deal, it could involve divesting a majority or minority stake in that business, according to the sources.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Marathon, MPLX and Intrepid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Marathon had previously said it had formed a special board committee to explore options for its midstream operations, but had not announced a specific course of action.Marathon Petroleum shares ended trading down 9% in New York, giving it a market value of $20.3 billion. Its debt obligations totaled $29 billion as of the end of December, $20.1 billion of which stemmed from MPLX and its subsidiaries. MPLX shares ended trading down 8.7%, giving it a market value of $16.3 billion.Under pressure from activist shareholders, including hedge funds Elliott Management Corp and D.E. Shaw Group, Marathon announced in October it would explore options for its pipeline and storage operations, and look at spinning off its retail gas station business Speedway.Marathon held negotiations to sell Speedway to Japan’s Seven & i Holdings Co for more than $20 billion, but the talks collapsed earlier this month after banks balked at financing the 7-Eleven convenience store operator’s bid, one of the sources said. A sale of the MPLX assets could help compensate for that abandoned divestment.MPLX’s G&P assets generated earnings before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation of $1.75 billion in 2019, according to the company’s full-year results statement.MPLX is structured as a tax-efficient master limited partnership, in which Marathon is the general partner.

BG Groups bonds traded up strongly on Wednesday on the back of Royal Dutch Shells US$70bn offer to buy the UK firm. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannThe company is in the midst of a massive asset sale, shedding properties from Thailand to the North Sea to pay down debt following its $54 billion purchase of smaller British rival BG Group last year.Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, has sold around $15 billion of assets over the past year as part of a planned $30 billion in asset sales to trim debt incurred from the transaction.Bidders for Shells 158,000 barrel-per-day Martinez refinery, located 30 miles (48 km) northeast of San Francisco, include PBF Energy PBF.N and NTR Partners III LLC.Still, sources familiar with the issue say the company wants to sell for a higher price, with one saying the plant could be valued at about $900 million.Shell, which barred potential buyers from hiring advisors during a first round of the auction, has since allowed third parties to review materials related to a sale, according to one person familiar with the negotiations.Shell declined to comment. PBF referenced its quarterly calls with analysts, where it has said it considers all refining and logistics assets that come on the market, but declined to comment on interest in the specific plant. NTR did not respond to requests for comment.Shell retained Lazard last year to advise on the overall asset sale program. In the fall, Shell retained Deutsche Bank to find a buyer for the Martinez facility.EXIT FROM CALIFORNIA?Over the past 15 years, Shell has sold refineries in Bakersfield and Wilmington, California. Selling the Martinez plant would mark its exit from the state.While state-specific emissions regulations and fuel standards make it more expensive to operate a refinery in California, the plant still drew interest because of its location and ability to process local crude.Among the bidders, PBF bought a refinery in Torrance, California last year, while privately held NTR Partners has bid on other California plants.California’s environmental regulations and pipeline connections make the state an island, with few sources for gasoline imports.As a result, when one plant in California is shuttered, margins at other refineries in the state surge.Most operators in the state own more than one plant. PBF, one of the only California refiners with a single operation, would consider buying a second to hedge against disruptions at its troubled Torrance refinery, Jeff Dill, PBF’s president for West Coast operations said last month.The Martinez refinery, which has been operating since 1915, processes crude into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other refined products and has a coker unit for processing heavy crude.The potential sale would include a pipeline that brings crude produced in California’s San Joaquin Valley to the refinery."

Asset Sale,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/jx-nippon-is-said-to-prepare-sale-of-north-sea-oil-gas-fields,An energy transition loophole is allowing Big Oil to offload high-polluting assets to private buyers,"An oil flare burns at Repsols oil refining complex in Cartagena, Spain. Repsol was one of the top sellers of assets between 2017 and 2021 in EDFs analysis. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOil and gas giants are increasingly selling off dirty assets to private firms, amplifying concerns that the fossil fuel industrys traditional dealmaking is not compatible with a net-zero world. It comes at a time when oil and gas majors are under immense pressure to set short and medium-term targets in line with the goals of the landmark Paris Agreement. It is widely recognized that this accord is critically important to avoid the worst of what the climate crisis has in store. Research published last week by the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund shows how oil and gas mergers and acquisitions, which may help energy giants execute their transition plans, do not help to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. To be sure, the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, is the chief driver of the climate crisis and researchers have repeatedly stressed that limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius will soon be beyond reach without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors. EDFs analysis of over 3,000 deals between 2017 and 2021 shows how flaring and emissions commitments disappear when tens of thousands of wells are passed from publicly traded companies to private firms that have no oversight or reporting requirements to shareholders.These transactions can make it look as though sellers have cut emissions, when in fact pollution is simply being shifted to companies with lower standards. Andrew Baxter Director of energy transition at EDFThese same often obscure private companies tend to disclose little about their operations and can be committed to ramping up fossil fuel production. Such deals are growing in both number and scale, EDFs research says, climbing to $192 billion in 2021 alone. ""These transactions can make it look as though sellers have cut emissions, when in fact pollution is simply being shifted to companies with lower standards,"" said Andrew Baxter, director of energy transition at EDF. ""Regardless of the sellers intent, the result is that millions of tons of emissions effectively disappear from the public eye, likely forever. And as these wells and other assets age under diminished oversight, the environmental challenges only get worse,"" he added.The report says the surge in the number and scale of oil and gas dealmaking has coincided with growing fears among investors about losing the ability to assess company risk or hold operators accountable to their climate pledges. It also suggests implications for some of the worlds largest banks, many of which have set net-zero financed emission targets. Since 2017, five of the six largest U.S. banks have advised on billions of dollars worth of upstream deals. As a result, the analysis calls into question the integrity of Big Oil and Wall Streets commitment to the planned energy transition, a shift that is vital to avoid a cataclysmic climate scenario.What energy transition?EDFs analysis used industry and financial data on mergers and acquisitions to track changes in how emissions may have changed after a sale. It is thought to be the first time that comprehensive data on how oil and gas majors transfer emissions to private buyers have been collated. In one example, Britains Shell, Frances TotalEnergies and Italys Eni — all publicly held firms with net-zero targets — sold off their interests in an onshore oil mining field in Nigeria last year to a private-equity backed operator.Shell said it would reverse up to $4.5 billion in writedowns on oil and gas assets after it raised its energy prices outlook . Ina Fassbender | Afp | Getty ImagesBetween 2013 and the point of transfer, almost no routine flaring had occurred under the stewardship of TotalEnergies, Eni and Shell, the top seller of assets from 2017 through to 2021, according to the EDFs analysis. Almost immediately thereafter, however, flaring dramatically increased. The case study was said to highlight the climate risks stemming from upstream oil and gas transactions. Gas flaring is the burning of natural gas during oil production. This releases pollutants into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, black carbon and methane — a potent greenhouse gas. The World Bank has said ending this ""wasteful and polluting"" industry practice is central to the broader effort to decarbonize oil and gas production. A spokesperson at Eni said the company does not consider asset sales as a tool to reduce emissions and the firms strategy to reach carbon neutrality by the middle of the century is based on a set of measures that includes zero flaring by 2025. ""Questions regarding specific asset sales should be directed to the operator,"" they added. ""In general terms, all asset sales contracts must comply with local regulations, they include clauses related to the respect of human rights, and they are subject to Government approval."" CNBC has contacted Shell and TotalEnergies to comment on EDFs analysis.A wink wink, nod nod approachAndrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at nonprofit Ceres, told CNBC that EDFs research shows there has been something of a ""wink wink, nod nod approach"" to transferred emissions to date, whereby energy majors sell off high-polluting assets without worrying too much about whether the purchaser is going to do what they are supposed to. ""But whats interesting is that those private equity firms tend to be backed by public money. You know, it is public pensions funds that are the partners in those firms so there is leverage there,"" he added. Larry Fink, CEO and Chair of BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, sharply criticized oil and gas giants for selling out to private firms during the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, last year. Fink said the practice of public disclosed companies selling high-polluting assets to opaque private enterprises ""doesnt change the world at all. It actually makes the world even worse.""In July 2021, some of the worlds largest oil and gas majors were ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars as part of a $7.2 billion environmental liabilities bill to retire aging oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico that they used to own. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCeres Logan said that an important part of responsible asset transfer must be reckoning with the costs of shutting down wells at the end of their lives. In North America, for example, he highlighted the ""huge problem"" with so-called ""orphan wells."" These are oil and gas wells abandoned by fossil fuel extraction industries which can end up in the hands of companies with no ability or intention of cleaning them up. ""It is interesting to look at how different the asset sale process is in most of North America compared to the assets in the Gulf of Mexico because, in the Gulf of Mexico, there are federal rules that basically say if you sell an asset and the next company — or the next, next, next company doesnt clean it up — that liability comes back to you,"" Logan said. ""So, you have a very strong interest in picking your partners wisely and making sure they have the money to clean the well.""In July last year, some of the worlds largest corporate emitters were ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars as part of a $7.2 billion environmental liabilities bill to retire aging oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico that they used to own. The case was thought to be a watershed moment for future legal battles over cleanup costs. ""I think we need something like that in the rest of the world where theres an acknowledgment that that liability has to travel. It has to be paid for and we have to be aware of that at every stage of the process,"" Logan said.What can be done to tackle the problem?"

The sale of our December 31, 2017 investment portfolio for cash to BSP and the externalization of the Triangle platform by Barings delivers significant value to Triangle’s shareholders and accelerates the Company’s strategic transition to a senior-focused lender to the lower and middle markets. With over $304 billion of assets under management and more than 650 investment professionals, Barings possesses the scale, scope, resources and credit discipline to be successful in today’s competitive direct lending environment. We are gratified that a firm with the resources and reputation of Barings actively sought out a partnership with Triangle.”Triangle’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved the asset purchase agreement, the stock purchase and transaction agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the investment advisory agreement pursuant to which Barings will act as the Company’s investment adviser, and, subject to certain conditions, will recommend that Triangle’s shareholders approve the same, along with certain other elements of the transactions. Triangle intends to hold a special meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable to obtain the requisite shareholder approvals. The transactions are also subject to certain other closing conditions.In conjunction with the closing of the proposed transactions, Triangle will announce the redemption of the Company’s 6.375% Notes due December 15, 2022 (NYSE:TCCA) with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $80.5 million and the Company’s 6.375% Notes due March 15, 2022 (NYSE:TCCB) with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $86.25 million. Both series of Notes will be redeemed, following at least 30 days’ notice prior to the date determined for redemption, at a price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.Based on the terms of the asset purchase agreement under which BSP is deemed to have acquired the economics of Triangle’s investment portfolio at the signing thereof, the Company expects to discontinue paying a quarterly dividend starting with the second quarter of 2018. The transactions are expected to close in June or July of 2018, at which time shareholders will receive the payment of $1.78 per share as part of the Barings externalization transaction.Houlihan Lokey Capital Inc. served as financial adviser and Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP served as legal counsel to Triangle.

REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier/File PhotoSocGen said on Wednesday that the capital gain from the Lyxor sale would be around 430 million euros, adding that the transaction would conclude the “refocusing programme” it launched in 2018.CEO Frederic Oudea is revamping SocGen’s markets business and exiting some areas after losses in structured products wiped out earnings at its equities business in the first half of last year.SocGen said the sale would cover Lyxor’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other active and alternative management activities for institutional clients in France and abroad, with SocGen retaining some Lyxor operations.The disposal would have an estimated positive impact of approximately 18 basis points on the group’s core Tier 1 equity ratio, SocGen said, adding that it aims to complete the proposed deal by February 2022.Reuters reported at the end of March that SocGen was in advanced talks with both France’s Amundi and U.S. company State Street Corp to sell Lyxor..Amundi, which is a subsidiary of French bank Credit Agricole, said the proposed deal would make it Europe’s leader in ETFs.“The acquisition of Lyxor will accelerate the development of Amundi, as it will reinforce our expertise, namely in ETF and alternative asset management,” said Amundi CEO Yves Perrier.Lyxor, which ranks as Europe’s third-largest ETF provider, had about 82.3 billion euros of assets under management in ETFs in February, representing half of its operations.SocGen and Amundi shares were up 1.3% and 2.3% respectively in early trade, both outperforming a 0.2% gain for France’s CAC 40 blue-chip index.Shares in SocGen, which reported a better than expected fourth-quarter profit two months ago, have gained 35% so far this year, against a 19.8% increase for the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index.($1 = 0.8424 euros)"
Asset Sale,https://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/15/america-movil-looks-to-sell-assets-for-at-least-20-billion-sources.html,Lumen Technologies Lines Up a Big Asset Sale,"Recently, Lumen Technologies (LUMN -1.48%) management indicated a strong interest in consummating strategic asset sales to accelerate its debt reduction efforts. Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report indicated that Lumen was negotiating the possible sale of a significant part of its domestic consumer operations to Apollo Global for upwards of $5 billion.On Monday, Lumen did announce a big asset sale agreement. However, it wasnt the asset sale most investors were expecting. Lets take a look.Separating the Latin America businessAlternative investment firm Stonepeak has agreed to buy Lumens Latin American business for $2.7 billion. Australias largest pension fund will also participate in the investment. Today, Lumens footprint in the region includes subsea and terrestrial fiber as well as a network of data centers.Lumen will maintain a strategic relationship with the Latin America operations it is selling. The two companies will work together to serve joint customers.Management says the sale price equates to nine times the Latin American business estimated 2020 adjusted EBITDA. (That implies the unit generated adjusted EBITDA of about $300 million last year.) Lumen expects to close the deal in the first half of 2022, after receiving necessary regulatory approvals and meeting other conditions.A decent valuationThis weeks news had virtually no impact on Lumen Technologies stock. Lumen shares ended the day on Wednesday virtually unchanged from where they stood at the end of last week. Indeed, the deal announcement contained fodder for both bulls and bears.On the bright side, a valuation of nine times adjusted EBITDA represents a huge premium to the current market value of Lumen Technologies entire business. Lumen ended the first quarter with $31 billion of net debt, and it has a market cap just shy of $14 billion. That puts its enterprise value at $45 billion: approximately 5.3 times its projected full-year adjusted EBITDA of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.On the other hand, in a 2020 presentation arguing that Lumen stock was undervalued, management estimated that income associated with fiber assets should be valued at 10 to 12 times adjusted EBITDA. The companys willingness to sell fiber assets at nine times adjusted EBITDA casts doubt on that valuation analysis.That said, the majority of Lumens fiber assets are located in and between North America and Europe. Between those regions stronger economies and higher construction costs, it seems appropriate to value Lumens infrastructure there at a premium to its assets in Latin America. Moreover, if the companys fiber-based income streams were valued at nine times EBITDA but the rest of managements valuation assumptions remained intact, Lumen stock would still be dramatically undervalued at its current price.A good opportunity to accelerate debt reductionLumen has about $2.6 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months. It also has $1.6 billion of high-cost debt that can be called (repaid early) during that period.Between its internally generated cash flow and the proceeds from selling the Latin America business -- assuming it closes on schedule -- Lumen should be able to repay all of this debt rather than refinancing it. Even without any additional asset sales, that would likely get the company to the high end of its leverage target. (In 2019, Lumen set a goal of reducing debt to between 2.75 and 3.25 times adjusted EBITDA.)Once it reaches its leverage target, Lumen will probably start using some of its substantial free cash flow for share buybacks. That would accelerate its earnings-per-share growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation. The company could also consider raising its dividend, which already yields nearly 8%.Selling Latin American fiber assets wont address Lumens declining revenue trend, unlike the domestic asset sales the company has been investigating. However, selling its Latin American business will enable Lumen to finish fixing its balance sheet quickly. That makes this deal a good move for shareholders that should support further recovery in Lumens share price over the next few years."

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: expectations as to future sales of Dow’s products; the ability to protect Dow’s intellectual property in the United States and abroad; estimates regarding Dow’s capital requirements and need for and availability of financing; estimates of Dow’s expenses, future revenues and profitability; estimates of the size of the markets for Dow’s products and services and Dow’s ability to compete in such markets; expectations related to the rate and degree of market acceptance of Dow’s products; the outcome of certain Dow contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters; estimates of the success of competing technologies that may become available; the continuing global and regional economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19"") pandemic and crude oil supply and price volatility; estimates regarding benefits achieved through contemplated restructuring activities, such as workforce reduction, exit and disposal activities; and expectations regarding the benefits and costs associated with each of the foregoing.Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized and speak only as of the date the statements were made. In addition, forward-looking statements also involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond Dow’s control that could cause Dow’s actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; significant litigation and environmental matters; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; changes in laws and regulations or political conditions; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, market uncertainty, interest and currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices; business or supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war; weather events and natural disasters; ability to protect, defend and enforce Dow’s intellectual property rights; increased competition; changes in relationships with Dow’s significant customers and suppliers; unanticipated expenses such as litigation or legal settlement expenses; unanticipated business disruptions; Dow’s ability to predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand; Dow’s ability to complete proposed divestitures or acquisitions; Dow’s ability to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions if they are completed; the availability of financing to Dow in the future and the terms and conditions of such financing; disruptions in Dow’s information technology networks and systems; the continuing risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and crude oil supply and price volatility; and Dow’s ability to realize the expected benefits of restructuring activities if they are approved and completed. Additionally, there may be other risks and uncertainties that Dow is unable to identify at this time or that Dow does not currently expect to have a material impact on its business.Risks related to achieving the anticipated benefits of Dows separation from DowDuPont include, but are not limited to, a number of conditions outside the control of Dow, including risks related to: (i) Dows inability to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expects to receive from the separation from DowDuPont; (ii) certain tax risks associated with the separation; (iii) the failure of Dows pro forma financial information to be a reliable indicator of Dows future results; (iv) Dows inability to receive third-party consents required under the separation agreement; (v) non-compete restrictions under the separation agreement; (vi) receipt of less favorable terms in the commercial agreements Dow entered into with DuPont and Corteva, Inc. (""Corteva""), including restrictions under intellectual property cross-license agreements, than Dow would have received from an unaffiliated third party; and (vii) Dows obligation to indemnify DuPont and/or Corteva for certain liabilities.Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. For a more detailed discussion of Dow’s risks and uncertainties, see the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in Part II, Item 1A of the combined Dow Inc. and TDCC Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and Part I, Item 1A of the combined Dow Inc. and TDCC Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.

Asset Sale,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/prince-is-said-in-talks-for-asset-sales-to-help-ferro-deal,"Three Arrows Capital Eyes Asset Sale or Bailout, Confirms Co-Founder","Following the recent drama with the crypto hedge fund, one of the co-founders – Kyle Davies – said they are exploring different options, some of which include asset sales and getting rescued by another firm. Nevertheless, both Davies and Su Zhu remain believers in the crypto industry.Headquartered in Singapore, 3AC became one of the largest cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds in the past few years. However, the first signs of trouble emerged earlier this week when rumors started to circulate that it could face a massive liquidation in some of its positions.The situation took a turn for the worse a few days later when FT reported that 3AC failed to meet margin calls. BlockFi was among the lenders that had to liquidate some of the hedge fund’s positions.While initially the two founders, former classmates, remained relatively quiet, Davies opened up about the company’s dire situation in an interview with WSJ.He admitted that 3AC had suffered losses following last month’s collapse of Terraform Labs’ two native cryptocurrencies – the algorithmic stablecoin UST and LUNA. The hedge fund, along with others, participated in a $1 billion token sale event by Luna Foundation Guard and invested $200 million in LUNA as part of the deal.“The Terra-Luna situation caught us very much off guard,” said Davies.The plummeting prices in the broader crypto market in the past week or so harmed the firm’s positions as well.This has pushed 3AC into looking for desperate options, including “asset sale and a rescue by another firm,” said Davies.Despite the ongoing crisis, the co-founder asserted that they have “always been believers in crypto, and we still are,” before adding:“We were not the first to get hit. This has been all part of the same contagion that has affected many other firms.”"
Asset Sale,https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2013/10/01/apache-completes-sale-of-375b-in.html,Glencore puts Chad oilfields up for sale: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Mining and trading giant Glencore has put its oilfields in Chad up for sale, three sources familiar with the matter said, in a retreat from its foray into oil production following asset writedowns over the past decade.FILE PHOTO: An employee of a private security company stands in front of the logo of commodities trader Glencore during the companys annual shareholder meeting in Cham, Switzerland May 24, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoLike its oil trading peers, Glencore expanded in the upstream sector around a decade ago in order to secure oil flows, but the value of the assets tumbled with the oil price slump in late 2014.News of the Chad oilfields sale coincides with the retirement of Glencore’s head of oil Alex Beard at the end of this month and the separation of its upstream oil interests from marketing.The main producing fields are Mangara and Badila.Glencore’s net oil production from the West African country accounted for more than half its net production at 7,700 barrels per day (bpd) out of a total net 12,700 bpd. By comparison, oil majors BP produces close to 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.The sources said that Glencore put the assets up for sale less than a month ago and a data room including drilling and seismic details had recently been opened.The sale is being jointly run by U.S. bank Morgan Stanley and French bank Natixis.A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment and Natixis did not immediately comment.Glencore was started by trader Marc Rich more than 40 years ago specializing in oil trading.Over the past 20 years, it expanded into coal and metals mining but oil production constituted a small part of its business. Oil trading meanwhile grew to 5 million barrels per day, making Glencore the world’s second largest oil trader.It entered Chad in 2012 by buying minority stakes in some licenses owned by Calgary-based Caracal Energy and in 2014, the miner acquired the Chad-focused operator for $1.6 billion.However, the purchase was ill-timed taking place just months before a major oil price slump and since 2015, Glencore has booked impairments of $1.9 billion on its Chad assets after it scaled back its development program and froze drilling between early 2016 and the second half of 2017.In its 2018 report, Glencore said the recoverable value of its Chad assets was $1.2 billion and gross production was around 10,500 barrels per day. In total, Glencore’s upstream gross production was 35,000 bpd.Glencore has also booked impairments at its assets in Equatorial Guinea, though partially recovered, and in Cameroon. The company also holds an interest in Russian upstream company Russneft."
Asset Sale,https://www.reuters.com/article/jc-penney-bankruptcy-idUSKBN28H1WV,ConocoPhillips Announces Agreement to Sell Indonesia Assets for $1.355 Billion and Provides Notice that it is Exercising its Preemption Right to Purchase Up to an Additional 10% Shareholding Interest ,"Download .PDFHOUSTON – ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) today announced two transactions intended to core up the important Asia-Pacific segment of its diverse global portfolio.The company announced it has entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary that indirectly owns the company’s 54% interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a 35% shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company. The sale to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion is subject to customary adjustments and is expected to close in early 2022, subject to certain conditions precedent. The Indonesia assets being sold produced approximately 50 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021, and had year-end 2020 proved reserves of approximately 85 million barrels of oil equivalent. The effective date for the transaction will be Jan. 1, 2021.In addition, through its Australian subsidiary, the company announced that it has notified Origin Energy that it is exercising its preemption right to purchase up to an additional 10% shareholding interest in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) from Origin Energy for up to $1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, subject to customary adjustments. The ConocoPhillips subsidiary currently holds a 37.5% APLNG shareholding interest and would own 47.5% of APLNG upon closing if the other relevant APLNG shareholder does not exercise its preemption rights. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 and is subject to Australian government approval. ConocoPhillips’ full-year 2020 production from APLNG was approximately 115 MBOED, and full-year 2021 distributions are expected to be approximately $750 million, excluding distributions resulting from any additional shareholding interest arising from preemption. The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020.“Today’s announcement reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our company across every aspect of our global portfolio,” said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer. “The Asia Pacific region plays an important role in our diversification advantage as an independent E&P and these two transactions enhance that advantage by lowering our aggregate decline rate and diversifying our product mix. We are proud of our nearly 50-year history in Indonesia and pleased that MedcoEnergi recognizes the value of this business. We are also pleased to have the opportunity to effectively deploy the proceeds from the sale of our Indonesia assets toward additional shareholding interest in APLNG, which supplies LNG to long-term buyers in both China and Japan and is currently the largest supplier of natural gas to Australia’s East coast domestic market, meeting over 30% of its total demand. Through the achievements of APLNG and its other shareholders, Origin Energy and Sinopec, APLNG has become a world-class integrated LNG operation. It will continue supplying customers in the Asia Pacific region with reliable energy that is lower in GHG intensity than many of the alternatives, and thus help meet energy transition pathway demand for years to come.”-- # # # ---About ConocoPhillipsHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips had operations and activities in 14 countries, $87 billion of total assets, and approximately 9,900 employees at Sept. 30, 2021.

REUTERS/Loren ElliottSummarySummary Companies Past attempt to sell Houston refinery abandoned over priceBuyers market with five U.S. plants closed, several on offerHOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Chemical producer LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) aims to sell its Houston crude oil refinery as quickly as possible, said people familiar with the matter.The company on Wednesday said it is considering strategic options for the refinery, including a potential sale. U.S. refiners last year suffered deep losses as the coronavirus pandemic slashed demand for motor fuels.LyondellBasell joins a number of other operators that have put plants up for sale. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) last year offered its Convent, Louisiana, refinery and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) recently put a Belle Chasse, Louisiana, plant on the market.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register""They hope to sell as soon as possible,"" one of the people familiar with the matter said of LyondellBasell.SECOND TIME ON OFFERThe refinery along the Houston Ship Channel has been under Lyondells sole ownership since 2006, when the company bought out minority partner Citgo Petroleum (PDCSAC.UL) to end a troubled relationship.This is Lyondells second attempt to sell the Houston refinery, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration says can process 263,776 barrels per day of crude oil.The first attempt, in 2016, was hampered by repeated fires and breakdowns at the Houston refinery that cut production to a third of capacity in the spring of that year. But by the fall, the plant had recovered sufficiently to draw offers over $1 billion from Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) and Suncor (SU.TO).Saudi Aramco denied bidding on the plant, but sources familiar with companys negotiations said a deal fell apart when Lyondell raised the asking price before formal bids.Refinery values have fallen in the past five years as capacity, especially in the United States, is seen too great for an economy preparing to move away from fossil fuels for transportation.CHEMICAL EXPANSIONThe Houston refinery was once considered an essential source of feedstock for the companys chemical plants, but that changed following Basells purchase of Lyondell in 2007 and the companys emergence from bankruptcy in 2010.Since then, Lyondell has expanded, acquiring and building chemical plants around the world, especially in Asia as well as adding capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast.""While the Houston Refinery is a valuable, well-performing asset, we have long held the belief that it may be even more valuable as part of a larger refining system,"" Chief Executive Bob Patel said in a statement on Wednesday.Lyondell also said in the statement it cannot provide assurances regarding the outcome or timing of the review process.Bank of America is acting as a financial adviser to LyondellBasell and Vinson & Elkins as legal counsel.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Rithika Krishna in Bengaluru and Erwin Seba in Houston; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Jonathan OatisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
