Litigation,https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-files-lawsuit-against-center-covid-control-over-invalid-and-false,AG Ferguson files lawsuit against Center for COVID Control over invalid and false test results,"Testing centers stored samples in trash bags, provided false negative results or sometimes no results at allOLYMPIA — Attorney General Bob Ferguson today filed a lawsuit against Center for COVID Control, an Illinois-based company that ran several testing centers in Washington state, for providing invalid, false and delayed COVID-19 test results to Washingtonians, or sometimes providing no results at all. The company’s unlawful practices included storing tests in garbage bags for over a week rather than properly refrigerating them, and backdating sample collection dates so that stale samples would still be processed.Employees reported that the company instructed them to “lie to patients on a daily basis” when Washingtonians complained about their delayed results.Ferguson’s lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, asserts the company violated the Consumer Protection Act when it deliberately failed to deliver prompt, valid and accurate results. Moreover, the company also violated the Consumer Protection Act when it made deceptive promises that it could deliver results within 48 hours. The Attorney General’s Office plans to file a motion for preliminary injunction soon to immediately stop the Center for COVID Control’s unlawful conduct. The office will request a preliminary injunction hearing for the soonest available date.“Center for COVID Control contributed to the spread of COVID-19 when it provided false negative results,” Ferguson said. “These sham testing centers threatened the health and safety of our communities. They must be held accountable.”Center for COVID Control operated about 300 testing sites nationwide. The company had at least 13 testing sites in Washington, located in Lakewood, Tacoma, University Place, Seattle, Bellevue, Auburn, Lynnwood, Everett, Port Orchard and Yakima. The company provided COVID-19 tests to thousands of Washingtonians.The company did not have a license to operate a business in any municipalities in Washington, except for Yakima, at the time they conducted COVID-19 tests. These testing sites paused all operations on or about Jan. 13, and are still closed.The company advertised that they could provide COVID-19 test results within 15 minutes for a rapid antigen test, and within 48 hours for a more accurate PCR test.However, in reality, the company was aware it could not actually process tests at this speed. Former employees reported that the company was receiving between 8,000 to 10,000 tests per day, and data entry staff could not keep up. The company’s owners refused requests to hire more staff to keep up with the demand for testing.Center for COVID Control stored week-old tests in garbage bagsEmployees began storing tests in garbage bags and piling them up in various corners of the office with no semblance of organization. Some former employees reported regularly finding tests sitting in trash bags that were over a week old, never refrigerated properly and never tested by the company’s lab.Testing samples can only keep for so long — a lab manager for the company reported that beyond three days, a sample is invalid. The company’s Director of Operations instructed employees to start falsely post-dating samples to make them appear more recent than they actually were, and submit them for testing anyway so the company could potentially still bill insurance companies or the federal government for the tests.As a result, Washingtonians received false negative results, invalid results or no results at all. One Yakima customer, who never received his test result from Center for COVID Control, reported that two of his family members received negative test results despite exhibiting severe symptoms of COVID-19 the day after being tested.As the company fell further behind on processing samples, they were flooded with calls about late or non-existent results. Call wait times were sometimes three hours long. Center for COVID Control instructed employees to tell patients to expect results in 24 hours, even if there was no information on where the sample was or if it would ever be tested. If a patient called multiple times asking for their results, employees were instructed to lie and tell them that their results were inconclusive and they needed to take another test, allowing the company to bill for two tests.Center for COVID Control has reportedly billed the federal government $124 million for tests for “uninsured” patients. The company frequently marked patients as “uninsured,” even if they were insured. Employees were instructed to mark patients as “uninsured” if the patient didn’t provide their insurance information by the time of testing or if their insurance company wasn’t listed on the company’s data entry form. As testing ramped up, the company “streamlined” their data entry form and autofilled “uninsured” as the default insurance for all patients.“My team was instructed to lie to patients on a daily basis”Several Washington patients and former employees submitted complaints to the Attorney General’s Office about Center for COVID Control.An Illinois-based employee, who was in charge of a data entry team, reports, “I had been uneasy for nearly all of my short tenure at [Center for COVID Control], but as trash bags of tests piled up and my team was instructed to lie to patients on a daily basis, I had had enough. I first requested a demotion from my shift lead position, and, shortly after that, I quit.”One Washingtonian visited Center for COVID Control’s Everett site for a rapid test. At the time, she had been exposed to COVID-19 and was experiencing symptoms. She was told her result would be available in two hours. After five hours passed, a testing employee told her the sample was lost and she had to take a second one.“Two hours after taking my second COVID-19 test, I still had not received a result from the Center for COVID Control. An employee told me that they could not find my sample again. However, one minute after being told my second test was lost, I received an email from the testing site telling me my COVID-19 test was negative.”Suspicious of the negative result, she booked another appointment at a Washington Department of Health testing site, and received a positive result.Details of the lawsuitFerguson’s lawsuit asks the court to order Center for COVID Control to:Stop all its unlawful conduct, including its misrepresentations to consumers and false test resultsPay civil penalties of up to $12,500 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act, which includes $5,000 in enhanced penalties for targeting vulnerable populationsRelinquish any profits the company made from its unlawful conduct, in addition to any attorneys’ costs and feesAssistant Attorneys General Daniel Davies and Will O’Connor are leading the case.-30-Washington’s Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.

Litigation,https://www.windowscentral.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit,"Activision Blizzard lawsuit: Timeline, statements, and everything you need to know","In July, a firestorm kicked off within the video game industry. Activision Blizzard became the center of the news cycle following a lawsuit filed in California courts accusing the company of creating a ""frat boy"" culture where women are victims of harassment, unfair pay, and retaliation. The lawsuit went into great detail about alleged past events and called for numerous forms of relief, including compensation and punitive damages.Since the lawsuit went public, the company has responded with a statement from CEO Bobby Kotick about plans to begin rectifying company culture and a huge walkout from employees. We expect the situation to continue into the foreseeable future, but whats happened so far? Heres everything you need to know about the Activision Blizzard lawsuit and whats happened since.Latest news on the Activision Blizzard lawsuitAs expected from a lawsuit this large, a lot has happened since it was filed, both inside and outside the company. Heres what has gone down.Activision Blizzard shareholders accept Microsofts offer — April 28, 2022Source: Microsoft (Image credit: Source: Microsoft)At a Special Meeting on April 28, 2022, Activision Blizzard shareholders voted to accept the terms of Microsofts acquisition proposal. Over 98% of shareholders voted ""Yes,"" garnering overwhelming support for the merger agreement. The deal was previously agreed upon by Activision Blizzards Board of Directors but also had to be agreed to by shareholders.Microsoft intends to buy out Activision Blizzard at $95 a share, currently a premium as the companys shares fell dramatically in the wake of the lawsuit. The deal is currently slated to be closed in Microsofts fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.Ravens union efforts continue — April 22, 2022Raven Software QA workers garnered a huge win in the push for unionization, obtaining clearance from the NLRB to hold a vote across the unit. The vote, which will be tallied on May 23, 2022, will determine whether or not the Game Workers Alliance will be officially recognized as the first gaming union at a North American publisher.Previously, Activision Blizzard had sought to require all of Raven Software to hold a unionization vote, increasing the difficulty in the unit being recognized. The publisher told Windows Central that it is currently ""reviewing legal options"" for what to do next.Alleged interference from Meta COO — April 21, 2022According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg, a former girlfriend of Kotick, pressured tabloid U.K. tabloid The Sun to drop a story on Kotick.The story wouldve reportedly detailed a restraining order obtained against Kotick, while the strategy for figuring out how to keep the story from being published was reportedly put together by a team that included Facebook and Activision employees.Whistleblower claims Gov. Newsom interfered with lawsuit — April 13, 2022A whistleblowing lawyer who had been with the DFEH since 2018 claims that the office of California Governor Newsom has interfered in the case against Activision Blizzard. As reported by Bloomberg, the lawyer, Melanie Proctor, claims that her former boss, Chief Counsel Janette Wipper, was fired by the governor with no explanation. Proctor also claimed that ""As we continued to win in state court, this interference increased, mimicking the interests of Activisions counsel.""Activision Blizzard makes 1,100 QA workers full-time employees — April 7, 2022Activision Blizzard hired 1,100 QA workers as full-time employees, including a pay bump to $20 an hour, with the company stating that ""We have ambitious plans for the future and our Quality Assurance (QA) team members are a critical part of our development efforts.""This wave of hiring across the Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment branches of the company notably does not include Raven Software QA employees who are still seeking to unionize. Activision Blizzard claims that it is following National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) guidelines in doing so.Company sued by family of employee who committed suicide — March 4, 2022The Washington Post reported that the family of Kerri Moynihan, a former finance manager at Activision Blizzard who was found dead during a company retreat, has sued Activision Blizzard. The suicide was first reported in the original DFEH lawsuit, although Moynihan wasnt referenced by name.The wrongful death suit claims Moynihans boss, Greg Restituito, initially lied to investigators and hid evidence about a sexual relationship with his employee. It also alleges the company refused to turn over Moynihans company-issued laptop to investigators.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson told Windows Central that ""we at Activision Blizzard were, and continue to be, deeply saddened by the tragic death of Ms. Moynihan, who was a valued member of the company. We will address the complaint through the legal process as appropriate, and out of respect for the family we have no further comment at this time.""Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard for nearly $70B — Jan. 18, 2022Source: Microsoft (screenshot) (Image credit: Source: Microsoft (screenshot))First reported in The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by the company, Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Activision Blizzard. While CEO Bobby Kotick didnt confirm whether the lawsuits impacted the companys decision to sell (he said in a VentureBeat interview that he doesnt think it affected the stock price and that the decision was based on resources), its hard to see how the lawsuits didnt affect the value of the company, along with some lackluster games of late.Kotick will be remaining as CEO until the deal is finalized. Xbox head Phil Spencer has been named Microsoft Gaming CEO, and Activision Blizzard will report to him. The WSJ reports that Kotick will step down once the company is fully acquired.Around 40 employees fired, pushed out since lawsuit — Jan. 17, 2022According to The Wall Street Journal, Activision Blizzard has ""fired or pushed out more than three dozen employees and disciplined about 40 others"" in response to allegations brought on by the lawsuit. An investigation collected about 700 reports from employees about misconduct and similar issues, although a spokesperson for the company denied the number.Employee announces shes suing company in press conference — Dec. 8, 2021In a press conference held outside the company in Irvine, California, an Activision Blizzard employee named Christine said she was suing the company. Christine, along with Lisa Bloom, a high-profile victims advocate lawyer, said she was harassed repeatedly at the company and was told not to go to HR. She also said she was demoted for speaking out.""When I complained to my supervisors, I was told, They were just joking and that I should get over it,"" she said. ""Ive been denied my full profit-sharing, denied shares in the company, and have had minimal raises in the four years Ive been employed with Blizzard.""They are asking for an apology from the company, a third-party review of the claims, and a victims compensation fund in excess of $100 million.Raven Software QA workers walk out — Dec. 6, 2021Responding to news that Activision Blizzard laid off around a dozen QA contractors at Raven Software, more members of the team announced they would be walking out. They demanded that members of the QA team be offered full-time positions, including the ones that were laid off. Some reports claimed some of the employees moved cities just a couple weeks before the layoffs. Other employees walked out in solidarity.Since then, the ABK Workers Alliance announced a work stoppage and set up a strike fund to support the laid-off devs and others who are participating.Nintendo head also speaks out — Nov. 22, 2021Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser called the recent Activision Blizzard reports ""disturbing"" in an internal email. He joins Jim Ryan at PlayStation and Phil Spencer at Xbox in calling out the company to employees.Xbox, PlayStation heads speak out — Nov. 18, 2021Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO, and Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, both responded to the Kotick allegations in internal emails obtained by journalists. Spencer said he was ""disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and action,"" and that he was ""evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard.""Similarly, Ryan said he was ""disheartened and frankly stunned"" by the reports.Report suggests Bobby Kotick knew of harassment claims — Nov. 16, 2021Source: Activision Blizzard / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Activision Blizzard / Windows Central)According to The Wall Street Journal, CEO Bobby Kotick not only knew about the sexual harassment claims, he worked to keep some of them quiet and didnt report multiple incidents to the board of directors. In one example, Kotick intervened to limit disciplinary measures against Dan Bunting, co-studio head of Treyarch (he has since left the company). He also reportedly covered up a rape allegation by a Sledgehammer Games employee. Kotick also allegedly threatened an employee himself.In a response, Kotick didnt address the allegations against him directly, but said that ""anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesnt really appreciate how important this is to me."" The board of directors also released a statement saying it would be standing by Kotick and that it remains ""confident"" that hes addressing workplace change.Employees were not satisfied with the response and staged an impromptu walkout. ""We have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy. We will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO, and continue to hold our original demand for Third-Party review by an employee-chosen source,"" the ABK Workers Alliance wrote on Twitter.Later, over 1,000 employees signed a petition calling for Koticks removal.Besides workers, many publications, including Polygon and Windows Central, called for Koticks resignation.Blizzard co-lead Jen Oneal resigns — Nov. 2, 2021Following J. Allen Bracks departure, Jen Oneal, previously the head of Vicarious Visions, and Mike Ybarra were appointed Blizzard co-heads. However, on the day of the companys Q3 2021 financial results, Oneal announced she was leaving at the end of 2021 to try and have a ""broader industry impact"" on diversity in the gaming industry.Later, it was revealed in a WSJ report that she was being paid less than her male counterparts even after being promoted and that she was sexually harassed during her time at the company.CEO Bobby Kotick announces hell take pay cut — Oct. 28, 2021Along with announcing company-wide changes, including the waiving of forced arbitration, a zero-tolerance harassment policy, and more, CEO Bobby Kotick announced he would be taking a pay cut. It was dropped to $62,500, the lowest amount allowed for a salaried employee under California law. He said it would remain in place until the board of directors sees that the changes have been implemented.Company fires 20 employees in response — Oct. 19, 2021According to the Financial Times, Activision Blizzard fired 20 employees after an internal investigation, citing harassment allegations. In a statement, chief compliance officer Fran Townsend said an additional 20 faced disciplinary action.The DFEH and the EEOC are now at odds — Oct. 8, 2021After the DFEH filed an objection to the proposed settlement, the EEOC responded with a memorandum on Oct. 8 that, in part, accused the DFEH of a conflict of interest. The potential ethics violation regards two DFEH lawyers who used to work with the EEOC on the case. The memorandum stated:Specifically, two DFEH attorneys — who play leadership roles within the organization — previously served as EEOC who helped to direct the EEOCs investigation into Commissioners Charge No. 480-2018-05212 against Activision Blizzard, Inc. These same attorneys then proceeded to represent DFEH in connection with these intervention proceedings, which seek to oppose the consent decree that arose out of the very investigation they helped to direct while at the EEOC.The EEOC gets involved, but Activision Blizzard agrees to pay $18M settlement — Sept. 27, 2021The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced that it filed a complaint against Activision Blizzard, mostly alleging that the company engaged in the practices outlined in the DFEH complaint (that employees engaged in sexual harassment, retaliation, etc.).However, not too long after the announcement, Activision Blizzard revealed that it had agreed to settle with the EEOC and create an $18 million fund for the purpose of making amends to those affected. The company also said it would be developing training programs and software to improve workplace practices.""We will continue to be vigilant in our commitment to the elimination of harassment and discrimination in the workplace,"" Kotick said in a press release.However, reaction to the news was mixed. The Communication Workers of America (CWA), which previously had filed a complaint against ABK for allegedly using coercive tactics and intimidation, tweeted that the $18 million figure was a ""slap in the face to workers"" and that it was ""mere pennies"" compared to the companys full net worth. The DFEH also argued that the settlement could impact its case against the company by allowing it to potentially destroy evidence. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson, meanwhile, said the amount was agreed on with the EEOC.Activision Blizzard subpoenaed by SEC — Sept. 20, 2021On Sept. 20, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company, along with several leaders like Bobby Kotick, had been subpoenaed by the SEC. Theyve been asked to hand over documents, such as minutes from board meetings, personnel files, separation agreements, and more.The SEC is an organization that typically protects investors against market manipulation and other financial falsehoods from companies, so the news of the subpoena was quite surprising. However, the purpose of it was to ""discern whether Activision and its executives properly disclosed allegations ... and whether any of that information should have been shared earlier with investors,"" according to the WSJ.A spokesperson for the company said in a statement issued to WSJ that, ""the company is cooperating with the SEC.""The DFEH expanded its lawsuit against the company, in a report from Axios. The documents allege that Activision Blizzard has been interfering with the investigation, including the shredding of documents related to the suit.Essentially, the state requires employees to maintain records related to a complaint if its filed, but the amendment says Activision Blizzard did not produce documents, saying that they didnt exist or that they were confidential. The DFEH also says that human resources personnel documents related to the investigation ""were shredded ... thirty (30) days after an employees separation.""The amendment also says Activision Blizzards hiring of WilmerHale has interfered with the investigation. In other news, the DFEH also changed some wording, including calling ""employees"" ""workers,"" which would include temporary workers as well as employees.Leadership steps down — Aug. 3, 2021Blizzard president J. Allen Brack stepped down from the company in August. Jen Oneal, previously the head of Vicarious Visions and executive vice president of development at Blizzard, and Mike Ybarra, whos most known for working at Xbox before joining Activision Blizzard in 2019, will co-lead the studio moving forward. Brack was one of the names brought up in the lawsuit.The same day, Bloomberg reported that Jesse Meschuk, the companys top HR executive, has also left the company.Esports leagues are funded in part by corporate sponsorships, and that includes entities like the Overwatch League and the Call of Duty League. This week, Coca-Cola, Kellogg, State Farm, and T-Mobile were all reassessing their partnerships with Activision Blizzards Overwatch League, according to The Washington Post. Later this week, Kellogg confirmed it would no longer advertise Cheez-It or Pringles in the Overwatch League. T-Mobile also noted it would be pausing its sponsorship.More reports emergeFollowing the walkout, numerous outlets published reports expanding on the initial allegations in the lawsuit and stating new ones.On July 28, Kotaku published an in-depth look into the Cosby Suite named in the lawsuit. The room was reportedly a place filled with booze where people could go for parties. In addition, it featured a large portrait of Bill Cosby, who was accused of sexual assault by numerous women and was convicted in 2018 for aggravated indecent assault (although that conviction was overturned this year).On July 29, The New York Times published its investigation into the lawsuit and subsequent walkout. One former employee interviewed for the article said that she was paid less than a former boyfriend, who joined the company at the same time and performed similar tasks. She also said that she denied drugs from her manager, which she alleges hurt her career.""It is absolutely a rock-star mentality, and it touched almost every aspect of Blizzard culture.""Many reports emerged on July 30. One from IGN affirmed a lot of what had been alleged of the drinking culture at the company, but also went deeper into how women, specifically pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, were treated. One source noted how men would often walk into the breastfeeding room and stare at the women using it. Another person told IGN that they had trouble getting time off to go to the doctor as a pregnant woman. While a lot had been done to cut down on the companys drinking culture, many sources noted that it hadnt been enough, saying what was done was akin to ""putting lipstick"" on the problem.Vice resurfaced a story from 2018 where a former Activision Blizzard IT worker was arrested after putting cameras in the companys Minnesota office bathroom with the intent to spy on workers. It also published a story concerning a woman who had an indecent encounter with Blizzard employees at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015. She said, ""One of them asked me when was the last time I was personally penetrated, if I liked being penetrated, and how often I got penetrated.""On Aug. 6, Waypoint continued its reporting with an article concerning Blizzards chief information officer, Derek Ingalls, and how he joked about sleeping with female assistants during a meeting. Bloomberg also published an in-depth piece on what the culture was like in the years leading up to the lawsuit, and how a predominantly male workforce affected egos and workplace behavior. Many of its developers were treated like rock stars.Activision Blizzard employees participate in a walkout — July 28, 2021Source: Carli Velocci / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Carli Velocci / Windows Central)In response to the lawsuit, employees within the company organized a walkout on July 28, 2021. Hundreds of employees walked out on the job, many standing in protest in front of Blizzard Entertainment headquarters. The point was to bring attention to four demands:An end to mandatory arbitration clauses in all employee contracts, current and future. Arbitration clauses protect abusers and limit the ability of victims to seek restitution. The adoption of recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and promotion policies designed to improve representation among employees at all levels, agreed upon by employees in a company-wide Diversity, Equity & Inclusion organization. Current practices have led to women, in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups that are vulnerable to gender discrimination not being hired fairly for new roles when compared to men. Publication of data on relative compensation (including equity grants and profit sharing), promotion rates, and salary ranges for employees of all genders and ethnicities at the company. Current practices have led to aforementioned groups not being paid or promoted fairly. Empower a company-wide Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion task force to hire a third party to audit ABKs reporting structure, HR department, and executive staff. It is imperative to identify how current systems have failed to prevent employee harassment, and to propose new solutions to address these issues.At the time of this writing, leadership hasnt responded yet to the demands.The industry responds — July 28, 2021Source: Ubisoft (Image credit: Source: Ubisoft)On the day of the walkout, around 500 current and former Ubisoft employees signed an open letter standing in solidarity with the walkout participants and calling for collaboration between Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, and other companies.""We believe you, we stand with you and support you,"" the letter said.Ubisoft had been embroiled in controversy of its own back in 2020. Multiple high-level executives were either fired or left the company following allegations of a toxic workplace environment and harassment. The open letter states that not enough has been done internally to deal with a lot of the issues.""We have stood by and watched as you fired only the most public offenders. You let the rest either resign or worse, promoted them, moved them from studio to studio, team to team, giving them second chance after second chance with no repercussions. This cycle needs to stop,"" the letter continued.Meanwhile, Jeff Strain, a former senior Blizzard employee who worked on StarCraft and Diablo and co-founder of ArenaNet and Undead Labs, wrote a letter to his employees giving them his endorsement to unionize. The letter, which was published in full by IGN, notes the number of awful stories hes heard while being in the industry and that the lawsuit left him ""disgusted and repulsed — but not at all surprised.""""I welcome my employees to unionize, and Im giving my full endorsement and support to an industry wide adoption of unions,"" he wrote. ""I also encourage the leadership of game-industry companies, large and small, corporate and independent, to join me in endorsing and advocating for unionization as a concrete, actionable step toward improving our industry.""Warcraft team removes inappropriate references from the game — July 27, 2021On July 27, the World of Warcraft team released a statement, noting that they had taken note of player feedback and would be removing inappropriate references from both Shadowlands and WoW Classic. Wowhead reported that this includes references to former creative director Alex Afrasiabi. Most notably, Field Marshal Afrasiabi was replaced by Field Marshal Stonebridge, among other changes.Development reportedly halts on World of WarcraftJeff Hamilton, a senior developer on World of Warcraft, wrote in a series of tweets following the lawsuit report that ""almost no work is being done on World of Warcraft right now while this obscenity plays out.""Activisions response to this is currently taking a group of world-class developers and making them so mad and traumatized theyre rendered unable to keep making a great game,"" he wrote.What is the Activision Blizzard lawsuit?Source: Activision Blizzard (Image credit: Source: Activision Blizzard)The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) brought forward the civil lawsuit against the game publisher on July 20, 2021. The crux of the suit, which came after a two-year investigation, alleges that the company had created a ""frat boy"" culture where female employees were subjected to pay disparities, sexual harassment, and retaliation when they came forward.The suit claims that the DFEH attempted to contact Activision Blizzard about the allegations prior to filing. However, the ""parties were unable to resolve the administrative complaints."" The DFEH also said in the court documents that efforts to mediate were made, but they were unsuccessful.Overall, the DFEH said those affected suffered lost compensation and emotional pain. The DFEH is seeking relief for all the affected female employees, including punitive damages and unpaid wages.What claims are present in the lawsuit?Source: Carli Velocci / Windows Central (Image credit: Source: Carli Velocci / Windows Central)The suit begins with the claim that the company is only staffed by around 20% women and that ""few women ever reach top roles at the company."" Even when they do, they earn a smaller salary than their male counterparts and are offered fewer stock and incentive pay opportunities.The suit begins with the claim that the company is only staffed by around 20% women.""Women were steered into the lower levels of Defendants hierarchy and often had to work harder and longer to earn equal promotional and other opportunities as their male counterparts,"" the suit said.Either way, female employees report generally getting paid less than male employees who perform the same kinds of work. Similarly, the court documents state that male employees would get away with coming into work hungover and playing video games while delegating their work to female employees. They would also get opportunities that their female employees were not privy to.In one example, a female employee reported that one of her male counterparts was invited to weekly meetings with a VP when she was not afforded the same privilege, even after receiving great performance reviews and generating more money in her marketing campaigns.Sexual harassment was also rampant across the company. The suit lists several examples, including the pervasiveness of ""cube crawls,"" where male employees would drift from cubicle to cubicle harassing other employees. World of Warcraft female employees reported that male employees would make rape jokes and other inappropriate comments.One person named in the lawsuit was Alex Afrasiabi, who was formerly the senior creative director on World of Warcraft. Employees alleged that he engaged in inappropriate behavior at BlizzCon, and it was apparently so well known that his suite was nicknamed the ""Cosby Suite.""The companys culture particularly targeted women of color. For example, one Black employee stated that she was micromanaged by her supervisor, who made her write a summary of what she would do on her time off, which was not department policy.The suit also claims that pregnancy discrimination occurred at the company. For example, one woman said that she was denied a promotion because ""they could not risk promoting her as she might get pregnant and like being a mom too much."" Breastfeeding rooms were also used for meetings instead of their intended use, and employees using the room were kicked out.In one particularly heartbreaking example, a female employee died by suicide on a business trip after sexual harassment.What have the responses been from leadership?Source: Steven Simko / Wikimedia CommonsCEO Bobby Kotick. (Image credit: Source: Steven Simko / Wikimedia Commons)Activision Blizzards initial response to the lawsuit wasnt kind to the DFEH, calling a lot of the claims ""distorted, and in many cases, false.""""We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind,"" a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard told Bloomberg Law in a statement. ""We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue.""Other responses from company leadership have been mixed. Former Blizzard President J. Allen Brack, who is named in the lawsuit, called the allegations ""extremely troubling"" in an internal email.""I feel angry, sad, and a host of other emotions, but I also feel grateful to work alongside a set of leaders and thousands of employees who join me in their commitment to continuous improvement,"" he continued, saying that leadership would be meeting with employees to discuss how to move forward.On the other hand, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Frances Townsend echoed the original company statement in her internal email. She said the lawsuit ""presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago.""Meanwhile, CEO Bobby Kotick published a statement saying that the original Activision Blizzard response was ""tone deaf.""""It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding,"" Kotick wrote.Whats next for Activision Blizzard and the lawsuit?Source: Coolcaesar / Wikimedia Commons (Image credit: Source: Coolcaesar / Wikimedia Commons)We cant say for sure what will happen with the company going forward, but we can make some predictions based on similar past events and statements from leadership.Its unlikely that the case will go to trial. A lot of DFEH cases end in a settlement, so this case will probably end in one as well. More importantly, we can expect Activision Blizzard to introduce big changes to the company to counter the allegations. So far, the company hasnt responded to the walkout organizers demands, nor has it released a concrete plan to address the allegations.Based on company leaderships statements and internal emails, we expected an overview of hiring practices, or at least a statement breaking down how the company will do so, and that has happened. At the start, Kotick noted that he wanted to work with hiring managers to ensure ""they have diverse candidate slates for all open positions"" and to evaluate managers and other leaders and to terminate those who ""impeded the integrity of our processes."" Activision Blizzard also hired a third-party law firm, WilmerHale, to review company policies. (Its worth noting, as pointed out by Kotaku, that this is the same firm that Amazon is using to prevent workers from unionizing.) Multiple execs have mentioned wanting to hold discussions with current employees to get feedback. According to an Uppercut Crit article, a source mentioned that ""any future all hands style meetings have been tabled in favor of smaller group discussion sessions.""Inappropriate content will also be removed from games. So far, Afrasiabi references have been removed from World of Warcraft and Jesse McCrees name was changed in Overwatch, but were sure to see other changes moving forward.

Litigation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-litigation-settlement-idUSKBN23V2NP,Bayer to pay up to $10.9 billion to settle bulk of Roundup weedkiller cancer lawsuits,"FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bayer AG, after more than a year of talks, agreed to pay as much as $10.9 billion to settle close to 100,000 U.S. lawsuits claiming that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup caused cancer, resolving litigation that has pummeled the company’s share price.The German drugs and pesticides maker has come to terms with about 75% of the 125,000 filed and unfiled claims overall, it said in a statement on Wednesday of the deal to end legal disputes it inherited with its $63 billion takeover of Monsanto in 2018.The settled cases over Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers account for about 95% of those currently set for trial, it added.“The Roundup settlement is the right action at the right time for Bayer to bring a long period of uncertainty to an end,” Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said. “Unfortunately, we have to pay an awful lot of money for a product which is perfectly regulated.”The company said it will make a payment of $8.8 billion to $9.6 billion to resolve the current Roundup litigation - including an allowance expected to cover unresolved claims - and $1.25 billion to support a separate class agreement to address potential future litigation.Bayer did not admit liability or wrongdoing.“Bayer is not getting complete relief, but trying to do as much as it can to calm uncertainty,” said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School who has followed the litigation.The deal dwarfs previous out-of-court product liability settlements, such as Merck & Co’s $5 billion deal to end litigation over its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx, and Bayer deals worth $2 billion to settle claims of harm caused by its Yasmin and Yaz birth control pills.Ken Feinberg, who was appointed settlement mediator by a federal judge more than a year ago, said that while nearly 25,000 claims remained unsettled there will be no more trials as cases settle in coming months.FILE PHOTO: The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the facade of the historic headquarters of the German pharmaceutical and chemical maker in Leverkusen, Germany, April 27, 2020. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo""Bayer wisely decided to settle the litigation rather than roll the dice in American court,"" said Feinberg, who has mediated other high-profile disputes, including over the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster and Volkswagens VWOG_p.DE diesel emissions scandal.APPEALS TO CONTINUEThe three cases that have gone to trial will continue through the appeals process and are not covered by the settlement, Bayer said.A U.S. federal appeals court on Monday permanently blocked California from requiring a cancer warning on glyphosate-based Roundup. That ruling is separate from the wider litigation over whether Roundup causes a type of blood cancer.The company, whose management in April regained shareholder support for its handling of the litigation, has denied claims that Roundup or its active ingredient glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the product is safe for human use.Bayer said it expects to maintain its investment grade credit ratings and intends to keep its dividend policy.The prospect of a surge in fresh lawsuits, fighting more than 20 trials a year and the accompanying unfavorable media coverage swayed Bayer to come to terms with claimants.“We are well aware of the negative impact high profile trials already have had on our business and reputation,” Baumann said.Bayer shares are down 29% since it closed the Monsanto deal in June 2018. At one point last year as juries ruled against the company, Bayer’s market value had fallen below what it paid for Monsanto.As of April, the company had been sued by 52,500 U.S. plaintiffs who blame glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer, up from 48,600 in February. Law firms had lined up tens of thousands of additional claimants with cases yet to serve.Bayer will continue to sell Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974. It will not add a cancer warning label to the product, a company spokesman said.Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company’s genetically modified seeds.Potential future cases will be governed by a class agreement subject to court approval. The agreement includes the establishment of an independent scientific panel that will determine whether Roundup can cause cancer and, if so, at what minimum levels.Bayer and the plaintiffs are bound by the panel’s determination and no new lawsuits can be filed while the experts evaluate the science, a process expected to take about four years, Bayer said.Separately, Bayer agreed to resolve most cases in litigation over waste water contaminated with PCB, which Monsanto manufactured before 1977, for $820 million.It also came to terms for up to $400 million to resolve lawsuits brought by land owners who say their crops were damaged by neighbors using Bayer’s dicamba-based weedkiller. The product is alleged to evaporate easily and waft away from the target field."

Litigation,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-jj-exploring-putting-talc-liabilities-into-bankruptcy-sources-2021-07-18/,EXCLUSIVE: J&J exploring putting talc liabilities into bankruptcy,"July 18 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is exploring a plan to offload liabilities from widespread Baby Powder litigation into a newly created business that would then seek bankruptcy protection, according to seven people familiar with the matter.During settlement discussions, one of the healthcare conglomerate’s attorneys has told plaintiffs’ lawyers that J&J could pursue the bankruptcy plan, which could result in lower payouts for cases that do not settle beforehand, some of the people said. Plaintiffs’ lawyers would initially be unable to stop J&J from taking such a step, though could pursue legal avenues to challenge it later.J&J has not yet decided whether to pursue the bankruptcy plan and could ultimately abandon the idea, some of the people said. Reuters could not determine whether J&J has retained restructuring lawyers to help the company explore the bankruptcy plan.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterJ&J faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma.“Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,” the J&J subsidiary housing the company’s talc products said in a statement provided to Reuters. J&J declined further comment.Should J&J proceed, plaintiffs who have not settled could find themselves in protracted bankruptcy proceedings with a likely much smaller company. Future payouts to plaintiffs would be dependent on how J&J decides to fund the entity housing its talc liabilities.J&J is now considering using Texass “divisive merger” law, which allows a company to split into at least two entities. For J&J, that could create a new entity housing talc liabilities that would then file for bankruptcy to halt litigation, some of the people said.The maneuver is known among legal experts as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used in recent years.A bottle of Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder is seen in a photo illustration taken in New York, February 24, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/IllustrationJ&J could also explore using another mechanism to effectuate the bankruptcy filing besides the Texas law, some of the people said.A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.The blue-chip company, which boasts a roughly $443 billion market value, faces legal actions from more than 30,000 plaintiffs alleging its talc products were unsafe. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J’s appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company’s talc caused their ovarian cancer.Plaintiffs’ lawyers view the two-step bankruptcy strategy as one that skirts potentially expensive settlements or judgments. Companies view it as a way to corral numerous lawsuits in one court for efficient negotiations that bankruptcy law dictates for asbestos liabilities. The company outside bankruptcy can reach a funding agreement with the entity navigating a court restructuring to cover future settlement payments.In 2017, Brawny paper towels manufacturer Georgia-Pacific used the Texas law to move asbestos liabilities to an entity that later filed for bankruptcy in North Carolina.Bankruptcy cases filed to resolve litigation, including those related to asbestos, often take years, and almost never fully repay creditors. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, for instance, is near resolving thousands of opioid lawsuits after two years of bankruptcy negotiations with a plan valued at more than $10 billion to address trillions of dollars in claims.Another company, DBMP LLC, filed for bankruptcy last year to resolve asbestos liabilities and said the case could take up to eight years, according to a company press release.J&J also faces litigation alleging it contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic and recently recalled certain spray sunscreen products after discovering some of them contained low levels of benzene, another carcinogen.The company in June agreed to pay $263 million to resolve opioid claims in New York. It has denied wrongdoing related to its opioids.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterAdditional reporting by Nate Raymond; editing by Vanessa OConnell and Edward TobinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Litigation,https://www.npr.org/2022/01/25/1075560742/oil-lawsuit-climate-change-baltimore,Lawsuit alleging oil companies misled public about climate change moves forward,"Lawsuit alleging oil companies misled public about climate change moves forwardEnlarge this image toggle caption AP APA federal appeals court in Virginia heard a landmark case Tuesday that seeks to hold major fossil fuel companies accountable for their role in climate change. The courts decision in the case will have implications for a raft of similar cases brought by cities, counties and states across the country.The case was brought by the city of Baltimore against some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, and it hinges on alleged disinformation by the corporations. The Baltimore city government argues that the companies must help pay for the costs of climate change, because they misled the public about how their products contribute to global warming.Like many cities in the United States, Baltimore has borne enormous and escalating climate costs, including millions of dollars of damage from floods and expensive infrastructure upgrades to address dangerous heat waves and rising seas.Baltimore was one of the first places to file a lawsuit seeking damages from fossil fuel companies. Since then, numerous cities, including Oakland, Calif., New York, N.Y., Annapolis, Md., Charleston, S.C. and Honolulu, Hawaii have pursued similar suits. So have several states, including Minnesota, Delaware and Rhode Island.None of the cases has progressed far enough for a judge or jury to hear any substantive arguments about whether oil and gas companies should pay for the damages caused by burning fossil fuels. Instead, the fossil fuel companies have focused their defense on the narrow jurisdictional question of whether such lawsuits can proceed in state courts, where they were originally filed.The Supreme Court considered the jurisdiction question in the Baltimore case last year, and decided that a federal appeals court should decide where the Baltimore lawsuit is heard, paving the way for todays arguments before a three-judge panel for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.The decision by the appeals court could affect the outcomes of other cases, especially the lawsuits brought by cities and counties that fall within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Circuit, such as Charleston, S.C. and Annapolis, Md. For example, if the appeals court finds that Baltimores lawsuit can be tried in state court, that decision would also apply to the suits brought by those cities.In his statement on behalf of oil and gas companies, attorney Kannon Shanmugam argued that state court is the wrong place for the lawsuit because climate change is global in scope, and is regulated by the federal government and by international agreements.The National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group, made an even more sweeping argument in a brief filed in support of the companies, writing, ""state courts are not positioned to decide who, if anyone, is to be legally accountable for climate change, how energy policies should change to address it, and how local mitigation projects should be funded.""Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans who studies climate liability cases, says that argument doesnt hold water, because the allegations against the companies hinge on state laws that are meant to protect the public from misleading marketing.Baltimore is asking state courts to weigh in on what Sokol calls a ""long-standing, systematic deceptive marketing campaign designed to hide the catastrophic dangers,"" of fossil fuels. Cases about consumer protection, including landmark lawsuits involving alleged corporate misinformation campaigns by tobacco companies, have historically been tried in state court.In his statement on behalf of Baltimores government on Tuesday, attorney Vic Sher argued the case is about ""disinformation and lack of disclosure.""Because the question of jurisdiction is still unresolved, neither side presented any evidence Tuesday about the underlying question: whether oil and gas companies are liable for misleading the public about how burning fossil fuels causes catastrophic climate change. The appeals court is expected to announce its decision about jurisdiction later this year."
Litigation,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/litigation-risks-for-energy-company-44698/,Litigation Risks For Energy Company Executives During Bankruptcy,"Spurred by the Russia-OPEC dispute and the worldwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the price of oil has fallen to historical lows. Many oil and gas companies face substantial doubt about their ability to continue as going concerns. A deluge of bankruptcies in the oil sector appears inevitable. Bankruptcy trustees, plan agents, and creditor and equity committees will no doubt second-guess the business decisions of officers and directors in the months preceding the filing of bankruptcy. Now more than ever it is vital that directors and officers in the oil and gas industry understand (1) the legal framework that governs their conduct as corporate fiduciaries, (2) the types of transactions that will face enhanced scrutiny during bankruptcy proceedings, and (3) what to do now to minimize their bankruptcy litigation risks. This article provides timely advice for directors and officers to protect themselves from potential litigation during the months preceding a bankruptcy filing.Litigation Risks for Ds&Os During BankruptcyWhen a company declares bankruptcy, plaintiffs’ attorneys, creditors, and bankruptcy trustees often sue directors and officers for a breach of their fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs’ lawyers are typically eager to take these cases, even on a contingency fee basis, because the D&O insurance policies are an enticing source of funds. Additionally, the bankruptcy trustee or, following confirmation of a bankruptcy plan, a litigation trustee (“Litigation Trustee”) has an obligation to maximize the value of estate assets, and will likely view claims against former directors and officers as an aspect of discharging that duty.In our view, breach of fiduciary duty claims are more dangerous when pursued by a Litigation Trustee than when pursued by shareholders in derivative litigation, for several reasons. First, a Litigation Trustee generally has access to all the bankrupt company’s documents and emails, without the need to engage in litigation discovery. Second, to the extent the Litigation Trustee needs additional discovery, it may have access to the more expansive discovery procedures provided by the bankruptcy court. For example, some courts have allowed trustees to take pre-suit, “fishing expedition” depositions under Bankruptcy Rule 2004. Third, the estate—not the Ds&Os—owns the attorney-client and work-product privileges, and often the litigation trust shares the privilege with the estate. Therefore, Ds&Os cannot shield from discovery emails or discussion with in-house or external counsel that occurred during their involvement with the company. Finally, unlike shareholder actions, a Litigation Trustee generally does not have to comply with Delaware requirements such as making a formal demand on the Board before bringing litigation.Common Claims Against Ds&Os of Bankrupt CompaniesThe most common claims against directors and officers of a bankrupt company allege a breach of the duty of care or the duty of loyalty.Duty of CareThe duty of care requires officers and directors to make decisions on an informed basis. See Smith v. Van Gorkom, 488 A.2d 858, 872 (Del. 1985), overruled on different grounds by Gantler v. Stephens, 965 A.2d 695 (Del. 2009). A Delaware company can immunize their directors for monetary liability for breach of the duty of care by including exculpatory clauses in the company’s bylaws, but officers cannot be so immunized. 8 Del. C. § 102(b)(7); see also Gantler, 965 A.2d at 709 n.37.In a duty of care case, the most powerful defense for directors and officers is the business judgment rule, which is “a presumption that in making a business decision the directors [and officers] of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 812 (Del. 1984), overruled on different grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (Del. 2000). To overcome this presumption, plaintiffs must show that the directors and officers acted in bad faith, were reckless, or made a decision in haste without adequate information or deliberation. Id.; Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244, 264 n.66 (Del. 2000). It can be helpful to establish a special committee of independent directors to review important transactions and to document their deliberative process in meeting minutes. Another important defense for directors is appropriate reliance on management, accountants, counsel, and other advisors in reaching their challenged decision.Duty of LoyaltyThe duty of loyalty “requires an undivided and unselfish loyalty to the corporation.” Guth v. Loft, Inc., 23 Del. Ch. 255, 270 (1939). To establish a breach of loyalty, a plaintiff must show that the officers or directors authorized a transaction when they either were self-interested (i.e., stand to obtain a unique benefit that is not available to shareholders) or lacked independence. See Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345, 358 (Del. 1993), decision modified on reargument, 636 A.2d 956 (Del. 1994). If an officer or director discloses a personal interest prior to the transaction in question, and that transaction is approved by a majority of independent, disinterested directors, then the protection of the business judgment rule will apply to the transaction. See 8 Del. C. § 144(a); Benihana of Tokyo, Inc. v. Benihana, Inc., 906 A.2d 114, 120 (Del.2006) (“After approval by disinterested directors, courts review the interested transaction under the business judgment rule . . . .”). For this reason, it is important for boards to convene a special committee of independent directors to approve any transaction that raises, or may appear to raise, a conflict of interest. This process helps establish that the corporate decision was approved by a majority of disinterested and independent directors, and thus entitled to the protections of the business judgment rule.Finally, the duty of loyalty also requires directors to “make a good faith effort to implement an oversight system and then monitor it.” Marchand v. Barnhill, 212 A.3d 805, 820–21 (Del. 2019) (citing In re Caremark Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996)). To show a breach of directors’ Caremark duty to supervise management, a plaintiff must show that directors were so negligent that “their indolence . . . could not be ascribed to anything other than a knowing decision not to even try to make sure the corporation’s officers had developed and were implementing a prudent approach to ensuring law compliance.” Desimone v. Barrows, 924 A.2d 908, 935 (Del. Ch. 2007). To avoid a Caremark claim, directors should take care to document its deliberations and, in particular, note instances when management is challenged or questioned.The Duties in the “Zone of Insolvency” and BankruptcyGenerally speaking, Ds&Os owe the same fiduciary duties notwithstanding the financial condition of the company. These duties are always owed to the company, not to shareholders or creditors. Of course, the company’s beneficiaries can change as its financial condition deteriorates. Delaware law no longer recognizes a “zone of insolvency” during which fiduciary duties begin to be owed to creditors. Rather, creditors only become beneficiaries to which duties are owed when a company is in fact insolvent. N. Am. Catholic Educ. Programming Found., Inc. v. Gheewalla, 930 A.2d 92, 101 (Del. 2007); See also Trenwick Am. Litig. Trust v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 906 A.2d 168, 191–192 (Del. Ch. 2006). Further, Delaware law does not recognize a claim for deepening insolvency, and the business judgment rule applies with equal force to companies in financial distress. Id. So long as the company was not insolvent at the time of the transaction, creditors generally lack standing to challenge the board’s decision to approve transactions, including deals which in hindsight cause or exacerbate financial harm to the company.However, as a practical matter, Ds&Os generally will not know in real time the precise moment a company becomes insolvent and thus creditors become its beneficiaries. In addition, some courts continue to refer to duties owed to creditors in the “zone of insolvency” without a nuanced consideration of the change in Delaware law caused by Gheewalla. Thus, it is prudent for directors considering a transaction during times of financial distress to document that their company is in fact solvent at the time of the transaction.Further, the duty of care may be heightened as a practical matter when bankruptcy is on the horizon because many difficult, important, and complex decisions arise during financial distress. Delaware courts require a director or officer to be more deliberate and informed the more complex or important a decision is. Similarly, a duty of care case may be premised on a failure to investigate irregularities or alleged misconduct, and conducting an expensive internal investigation may be less attractive when a company is flirting with insolvency.During these challenging times, Ds&Os must consider carefully how they can discharge their duty of care if they, or others in the company, are working remotely. Although many courts and regulators are relaxing wet-signature and in-person requirements during the pendency of this crisis, the Board may be unable to make certain decisions without an in-person meeting under the law of the organizing state or the company’s charter. Future plaintiffs will undoubtedly scrutinize whether adequate information-sharing and discussion occurred before key decisions. Remote work may encourage people at all levels of an organization to send via email information that would have otherwise been shared in person, creating a potential treasure trove of problematic documents for future litigation. Any relevant privacy laws may be difficult to comply with when working outside the office. Finally, cybersecurity risks increase as employees share information in new ways that may not be adequately controlled by the company.As with the duty of care, the duty of loyalty does not change during insolvency or bankruptcy, but Ds&Os may find themselves in tricky situations that implicate this duty during times of financial distress. For example, quintessential duty of loyalty claims allege unfair deals between parent corporations and subsidiaries, or the use of corporate authority to oppress minority shareholders or out-of-the-money creditors. Creative financial solutions or out-of-court restructurings, including liquidity and liability management transactions, may involve parent/subsidiary deals or changes of control that unhappy shareholders, creditors, or a Litigation Trustee could view skeptically.Transactions Plaintiffs Are Likely To TargetThe uncertain trajectory of COVID-19 and the recent collapse of oil prices —as well as the creativity of the plaintiffs’ bar—make it difficult to project precisely which decisions taken now are likely to be challenged in a later bankruptcy. However, certain types of decisions are more likely to be subject to future litigation and should be treated with particular care.First, as noted above, displaced shareholders often challenge restructure agreements that result in a change of control. Such challenges are more likely to be brought—and more likely to succeed—when the restructuring transaction is undertaken before a bankruptcy court is involved. While directors and officers are permitted to pursue creative restructuring plans, they should carefully document the reasoning supporting such a decision.Second, a Litigation Trustee may challenge investments in affiliated businesses that are not entirely owned and/or controlled by the primary company. If these affiliates don’t provide the expected return to the primary company, then a Litigation Trustee may allege that such payments breach the duties owed to the primary company’s shareholders. Ds&Os should carefully review any current funding provided to affiliates to ensure that the funds are provided according to the contracts with the affiliates and that any loans are properly papered. If the company creates new funding obligations to affiliates during this time, then the Ds&Os should be particularly careful to document the advantages of this arrangement to the primary company.Finally, a corporation’s creditors may challenge management’s actions effecting a dividend, redemption, or stock purchase (i.e., a stock buyback or stock repurchase)—or other liability management or liquidity management transactions. If the corporation was insolvent when these distributions to shareholders were made or was rendered insolvent by these distributions or other transactions, then the creditors may allege that the Ds&Os breached their fiduciary duties by effecting these distributions or that these distributions were fraudulent transfers. Before making a distribution, Ds&Os should determine whether the corporation, after making the distribution, would become insolvent under the traditional balance-sheet test, be unable to pay its debts as they become due, or have unreasonably small capital for its business. Delaware law “fully protect[s]” directors who rely in good faith on corporate records, corporate officers, and outside experts to determine the value of the corporation’s assets and liabilities. 8 Del. C. § 172. For this reason, directors considering a dividend payment or stock buyback generally solicit a certification from the CFO or an outside expert.The business-judgment rule generally protects the board of directors’ decision to declare a dividend or approve a stock buyback; it, however, does not shield the board from liability in situations of potential or actual conflict of interest. In certain situations, such as when a dividend distribution is part of the defensive measures against a hostile takeover, the potential conflict of interest may trigger enhanced scrutiny of the board’s actions. See, e.g., Reis v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., 28 A.3d 442, 457 (Del. Ch. 2011)). In other situations, such as when a board approves a stock-buyback transaction to purchase shares from the directors, the actual conflict of interest may trigger the entire-fairness standard (the most burdensome standard of review under Delaware law). While Delaware law allows a corporation to include an exculpatory clause in its certificate of incorporation to exculpate directors for breaching their duty of care, it does not allow directors to escape liability for breaching their duty of loyalty by making an unlawful distribution. 8 Del. C. §§ 102, 174. A final consideration is that, although directors are jointly and severally liable for an unlawful distribution, a director who was absent when the distribution was made or who voted against the distribution may avoid liability by having her dissenting vote recorded in the meeting minutes. 8 Del. C. § 174.Tips for Ds & os of Financially Troubled CompaniesWith these considerations in mind, we recommend the following to Ds&Os of companies facing financial trouble:"

Chief Executive Mike Roman said 3M was doing this ""in response to feedback from our shareholders and to provide additional clarity on the strength of our underlying business performance.""3M still beat Wall Street expectations in reporting a $1.29 billion profit for the first three months of 2022, compared with $1.62 billion at the start of 2021.Sales were essentially flat at $8.8 billion, a drop of 0.3% from the first quarter of 2021. Organic sales — a measure that does not include acquisitions, divestitures or foreign exchange — rose 2%.""We had a strong start to 2022, despite some of the macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,"" Roman said in an interview. ""Were still navigating the impact on supply chains from increased demand and some of the logistics challenges and COVID and geopolitical pressures.""Adjusted for PFAS-related commitments at the companys Belgium plant, earplug trial and other one-time legal expenses, 3Ms earnings per share were $2.65, beating analyst expectations by 33 cents. The total litigation adjustments amounted to 39 cents a share in the first quarter.Demand for 3Ms personal protective gear, like its N95 respirators, is waning as the COVID-19 pandemic slows. The safety and industrial segment posted a $50 million decline in disposable respirator sales for the January-to-March period after hitting a peak in the first quarter of 2021. The business unit overall saw sales decline 1.4% to about $3 billion.Respirator sales could drop as much as $200 million this year compared with 2021, chief financial officer Monish Patolawala told investors.Higher costs for raw materials and supply chain constraints added $215 million in expenses in the quarter. The company continues to raise prices to meet increased costs.""We called out inflation as on the horizon a year ago, February of 2021, and weve been managing it ever since,"" Roman said. ""You work with your customers and channel partners and make sure you understand your competitive value in the marketplace. And you leverage price as an important tool to help offset that inflation.""But Colin Scarola, an analyst at CFRA, an independent investment research firm, said 3M has ""very little pricing power given intense global competition for most of its products.""Scarola, who rates 3M stock a hold, said its recent price is ""much closer to fair value in a high inflation and energy cost environment.""3Ms transportation and electronics business dipped slightly to $2.3 billion in sales. It was buoyed by continued growth in automotive electrification, now a $400 million business. The company announced Monday it had acquired the technology assets of LeanTec to build on 3Ms ""connected bodyshop"" products.The consumer segment rose 1.8% to $1.3 billion. The company, seeking to capitalize on continued growth in online shopping and shipping needs, recently unveiled Scotch Cushion Lock, a recycled-paper alternative to plastic packaging cushion-wrap now available at major retailers.Health care saw the largest gain in sales, up 2.6% to more than $2.1 billion. Roman said the business has ample room to keep growing as elective procedures continue to rebound to pre-pandemic levels.The companys stock closed down nearly 3% Tuesday and is down about 19% for the year so far.3M lowered its full-year earnings per share estimate to fall between $9.89 to $10.39 compared with its previous guidance of $10.15 to $10.65.Excluding the $164 million it is spending on PFAS contamination in Belgium, executives said the outlook for the year remains unchanged.""Theres still a strong economic backdrop for the year despite all the challenges were facing,"" Roman said.

The settlement will be reflected in the company’s first-quarter financial statement.The settlement comes shortly after Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., Greeley, Colo., agreed to pay $75 million on Jan. 11. Both companies did not admit liability as part of the settlements.The settlement relates to “In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation” that claims that as far back as Jan. 1, 2008, poultry processors conspired to fix prices by coordinating production. The claims were made by foodservice, institutional and retail buyers of chicken.“(Tyson Foods) believes that the settlements were in the best interests of the company and its shareholders in order to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation,” the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Other poultry processors named as defendants in the suit include Amick Farms, Case Farms, Claxton Poultry, Fieldale Farms, Foster Farms, George’s, Harrison Poultry, House of Raeford Farms, Koch Foods, Mar-Jac Poultry, Mountaire Farms, OK Foods, Peco Foods, Perdue Farms, Sanderson Farms, Simmons Foods and Wayne Farms.Amick Farms, Fieldale Farms, George’s, Peco Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride have all reached settlement agreements with the plaintiffs.The civil price fixing case is not related to another cased where a grand jury in the US District Court of Denver indicted four executives at Pilgrim’s Pride and Claxton Poultry, Claxton, Ga., for their alleged role in a conspiracy to fix prices. In that case, Tyson Foods said it is cooperating with the investigation.After receiving a grand jury subpoena in April 2019, Tyson management said it uncovered troubling information about its operations related to the investigation and self-reported it to the Department of Justice. The company is hoping to escape punishment under the DOJ Antitrust Division’s leniency program."
Litigation,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/robbins-geller-gpm-will-lead-kraft-heinz-securities-litigation,,"Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP and Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP will represent co-lead plaintiffs in consolidated shareholder derivative litigation against Kraft Heinz Co. , after a federal court said the firms could handle a complex and resource-intensive undertaking.The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said there was no clear winner among the competing proposed lead plaintiffs, so it looked to their proposed legal teams to resolve the draw.Co-lead plaintiffs Stephen Silverman and Dale Waters, represented by Robbins Geller and GPM, were competing against proposed lead plaintiff Richard Merritts. Merritts is represented by by Hung G. Ta Esq. PLLC, who was proposed as lead counsel, and Zimmerman Law Offices, proposed as liaison counsel. Safirstein Metcalf LLP and Federman & Sherwood also appear on Merritts’ behalf.Although shareholder cases are “almost never small,” the court said this particular matter “bears the indicia of a larger and more complex undertaking with a sizable amount of money claimed as damages.”Given “high stakes,” the court said it made more sense to select “lead lawyers with vast resources and experience in cases of this magnitude.”The competing plaintiffs were all individual, as opposed to institutional, investors, and none disclosed their precise financial stakes. All vigorously prosecuted the case and their respective pleadings were of indistinguishable quality, the court said.Although he ultimately selected Silverman and Waters, represented by Robbins Geller and GPM, Judge Robert M. Dow Jr. said he recognized “the quality of the work done by Merritts and his lawyers” and their concern over being excluded from work on the case.In appointing Waters and Silverman’s legal team, Dow said “the Court trusts that lead counsel will consider the Merritts lawyers for appropriate work,” citing the their “thorough pre-suit investigation” and “the sound factual and legal points in their briefs on this motion.”The underlying allegations stem from the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods Group with the H.J. Heinz company to form Kraft Heinz, and revolve around alleged misrepresentations the new company made about its cost-cutting and growth strategies.Kraft Heinz is represented by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Jenner & Block LLP.The case is Hedick v. Kraft Heinz Co., N.D. Ill., No. 1:19-cv-01339, 10/21/21."
Litigation,https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/sc-electric-company-pay-315000-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-lawsuit,"S&C Electric Company to Pay $315,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Lawsuit","CHICAGO – S&C Electric Company, a designer and manufacturer of switching and control products for power transmission and distribution headquartered in Chicago, will pay $315,000 and furnish other relief to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.According to the EEOC’s suit, a principal designer who worked at S&C for over 52 years was diagnosed with cancer and later sustained a broken hip, for which he took medical leave. Following a long journey toward healing, the employee sought to return to his former position. The employee, who lived and worked in Chicago, provided numerous doctors’ notes indicating that he was fit to return to his former position, which was mostly sedentary. S&C decided, however, to fire him rather than permitting him to return to work following a perfunctory medical examination by an S&C contracted doctor.Such conduct violates Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrim­ination on the basis of disability. The EEOC and the employee filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (EEOC et al. v. S&C Electric Company, Civil Action No. 17-cv-06753), after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through the EEOC’s conciliation process.Under the 18-month consent decree settling the suit, S&C will pay $315,000 to the estate of the former employee. Further, S&C is required to maintain and provide the EEOC records of each employee at its Chicago facility who is terminated after attempting to return to work following a medical leave of absence and makes a complaint (whether orally or in writing) to S&C or to a government agency. In addition, S&C will provide two trainings conducted by outside and independent trainers to managers and all employees responsible for human resources and medical evaluations about their obligations under the ADA.Under the decree’s terms, if a qualified employee seeks to return to work after a medical leave of absence and is able to work, with or without a reasonable accommodation, the company may not dis­criminate against that employee by firing the employee rather than bringing him or her back to work. It further enjoins S&C from engaging in any form of retaliation, as defined by the ADA, for participating in any act required by the decree, assisting the EEOC with any investigation of violations of the decree, or asserting any rights under the decree.“The EEOC found during its pre-suit investigation of this charge that the employee was terminated because of his disability, in violation of the ADA,” said Julianne Bowman, the district director of EEOC’s Chicago office. “Employers are permitted to prevent employees from working if there is no way for them to do their job safely, but here the company disregarded the employee’s releases to return to work and failed to seek additional information to determine in greater detail what his capacities were. The ADA requires more of employers, and the EEOC will enforce it.”Gregory Gochanour, the regional attorney of EEOC’s Chicago office, added, “Individuals with disabilities often face stereotypes in the workplace that they are incapable in some way of doing their job. Here, we had an employee who performed his job well for 52 years, fell on hard times, and when he was ready to return to the place where he had spent virtually his entire working life, he was turned away despite his qualifications. This resolution helped bring some justice to this employee and his family and will likely lead S&C and other employers to act with significantly more care when making determin­ations about returning disabled employees to work.”For more information on disability discrimination, please visit https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination.The EEOCs Chicago District Office is responsible for processing charges of employment discrimination, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

The valves were supplied for use in U.S. Navy ships.“Requirements like the Mil Spec and QPL play an important role in protecting the quality of the equipment received by the government, as well as the safety of military personnel,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Companies that knowingly fail to comply with these requirements will be held accountable.”“We are committed to ensuring that the military gets what it pays for,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer B. Lowery for the Southern District of Texas. “We will vigorously enforce the rules and regulations governing military purchasing contracts.”“This settlement highlights the commitment of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the DoD acquisition process,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael Mentavlos of the DCIS Southwest Field Office. “DCIS will continue to thoroughly investigate allegations of fraud and product non-conformance and pursue all available remedies.”The settlement announced today resolves allegations that from May 2011 through September 2017, Crane supplied high performance butterfly valves to military ship builders that included Reinforced Teflon (RTFE) seats. From May 2011 to September 2015, Crane also supplied high performance butterfly valves that contained Monel bolting. The government contended that Crane sold the military Mil Spec valves with RFTE seats and Monel bolting that had not been approved for use by the Navy and failed to disclose these modifications to the valves in violation of the QPL Program, which governs the approval of products such as valves for use in military contracts.The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Corla Jacobson, a former Crane employee. The False Claims Act permits private parties to sue for false claims on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Jacobson v. Crane Co., No. 4:17-CV-01431 (S.D. Tex.). Ms. Jacobson will receive $855,728 of the False Claims Act settlement.The settlement was the result of a coordinated effort between the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas with investigative support from the DCIS and the U.S. Navy Criminal Investigation Division.Senior Trial Counsel Alicia J. Bentley of the Civil Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Bobb of the Southern District of Texas handled the matter.Related court documents and information from the civil lawsuit can be accessed on PACER.The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability."

In May 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld the Hardeman judgement. Bayer officials have maintained the Hardeman case could shape how future cases are litigated.In May, a federal judge rejected Bayers $2 billion Roundup settlement, and the company responded this week by outlining its legal strategy to investors.The company said it believes the Hardeman case offers its best chance of receiving Supreme Court review.""We actually do believe that the U.S. Supreme Court should give strong consideration to accepting our petition to review the Hardeman case and render a positive ruling,"" Baumann said.""We believe that the Hardeman case presents important legal topics such as federal preemption; new studies and regulatory rulings prove that science continues to be on our side. This includes a brief filed by the EPA with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in May, in which it affirmed, once again, that glyphosate, poses no human health risk of concern, as well as the most recent review in the EU.""Baumann said the company could face a significant financial upside if the Supreme Court grants a review and rules in Bayers favor.""The details provided today on the two scenarios should provide you with comfort that, based on the methodology we have shared, the glyphosate litigation exposure should now be reasonably accounted for and leave significant upsides,"" he said.""In the event of a favorable Supreme Court decision on the case, they should also remove the uncertainty and ambiguity that actually has been weighing on the company.""OTHER LEGAL BATTLES OVER GLYPHOSATEBayer acquired Roundup brands as part of its $63 billion purchase of Monsanto. Bayer continues to maintain that glyphosate is safe, regularly pointing out the EPA and many other countries regulatory agencies support glyphosates continued use.But during the past few years, Bayer has lost several lawsuits brought by plaintiffs who alleged their use and exposure to Roundup caused non-Hodgkins lymphoma and other cancers.EPA reapproved an interim registration of glyphosate in January 2020. The Rural Coalition, Organizacion en California de Lideres Campesinas, Farmworker Association of Florida, Beyond Pesticides and the Center for Food Safety filed a petition for review in March 2020. Those groups asked a federal court to vacate the decision.Most recently, EPA released a biological evaluation of glyphosates potential effect on endangered species and critical habitats, finding it was ""likely to adversely affect"" 1,676 listed species and 759 critical habitats, the vast majority of the species and habitats the agency considered.The agencys findings mean glyphosate will have to undergo more reviews before its routine registration review, initiated in 2009, can be completed, most likely sometime in 2021, according to EPA estimates on its website.Todd Neeley can be reached at todd.neeley@dtn.comFollow him on Twitter @DTNeeley(c) Copyright 2021 DTN, LLC.

But one company is taking its beef with the global food powerhouse to another level.McDonalds is best known for its world-famous burgers, fries, and broken ice cream machines lawsuit filed by Kytch cofoundersKytch, a startup that utilizes technology to monitor soft serve machines performance, has sued the McDonalds Corporation for $900 million for what Kytch alleges is a dereliction of duty regarding maintaining its machines, along with forcing independent operators to pay for costly repairs and maintenance to keep machines running.""McDonalds is best known for its world-famous burgers, fries, and broken ice cream machines,"" says the opening line of the lawsuit, filed by Kytch cofounders Jeremy OSullivan and Melissa Nelson in U.S. District Court in Delaware, where Kytch and McDonalds are both legally registered.Kytch, as described on its website, provides remote control, real-time data and analytics, and AI-powered predictive maintenance through a cloud-connected apparatus aimed to improve performance and keep machines up and running.The lawsuit alleges that ""some franchise operators have reported shelling out thousands of dollars per month in service fees"" to Taylor Company, which reportedly manufactures machines through franchised distributors.""McDonalds owes it to our customers, crew and franchisees to maintain our rigorous safety standards and work with fully vetted suppliers in that pursuit,"" McDonalds Corporation told Newsweek. ""Kytchs claims are meritless, and well respond to the complaint accordingly.""Taylor Companys website says that its products include soft-serve ice cream, frozen yogurt, milkshakes, smoothies and slushies, etc. OSullivan and Nelson allege that the partnership between McDonalds and Taylor remains viable because independent owner-operators, rather than Taylor itself, pay for service and repair fees, and Taylor develops new kitchen products exclusively for McDonalds.""Despite these widespread issues, McDonalds has failed to meaningfully improve the machines, and the fast-food giant has even granted Taylor exclusive rights to supply kitchen appliances to more than 13,000 retail locations in the United States,"" the lawsuit states. ""This arrangement generates millions of dollars of revenue for Taylor and its network of franchised distributors.""OSullivan told Newsweek that Kytch, which is shorthand for ""kitchen,"" and Taylor had a relationship that went back 10 years. Both companies worked on the Frobot, which OSullivan said took the worlds most ubiquitous ice cream machines—which are used at McDonalds, Wendys, In-N-Out Burger, etc.—that were supposedly ""robust.""But the pair of former California accountants, who were enamored with technology and the power of machinery, collected data in the Bay Area and eventually found that the machines werent all that robust at all.""It was a very harmonious, good relationship where we just worked together and it was very amicable,"" OSullivan said regarding Taylor. ""But as soon as we started using the software to make things reliable...thats when things immediately turned hostile. It became clear to us that theres way more money in broken money machines than machines that actually work.""He alleges that a 2018 Taylor acquisition statement allegedly showed that 25 percent of company revenue was made on repairs and maintenance. A $300 invoice provides the company with a ""perverse incentive"" to assure that machines dont work, he said.OSullivan compared the ""legacy distribution model"" to those of auto dealerships, which make profits off service repairs.Last May, as reported by Wired, Kytch sued Taylor and its distributor TFG for theft of trade secrets alleging that both entities, in addition to a franchise owner, obtained a Kytch device and reverse-engineered it for its own benefit.A spokesperson for Middleby, the parent company of Taylor, told Newsweek that a March 4 denial of Kytchs motion for a preliminary injunction filed in Alameda County ""concluded that there is no evidence substantiating the Kytch claims against Taylor.""""Kytchs latest lawsuit against McDonalds, like its existing lawsuit against Taylor in the Alameda County Superior Court, is a meritless attempt to put the blame on others for an unsuccessful business,"" the spokesperson added. ""We have tried not to replicate Kytchs strategy of litigating claims through the media, because the truth will never be as interesting as Kytchs wild allegations and because we are confident that Taylor will ultimately be vindicated in court.""The spokesperson said that ""Taylor did not conspire with McDonalds to ruin Kytchs business and has never attempted to obtain, or obtained, Kytchs trade secrets"" -- as evidenced by the The Alameda County Superior Court order, which ""thoroughly debunks these now discredited allegations.""The ""repair fees racket"" claimed by Kytch is completely false, the spokesperson added, saying that Taylor does not have a ""monopoly"" on providing soft serve machines to McDonalds.""In fact, Taylor understands that it is not the only company that provides soft serve machines to McDonalds,"" the spokesperson said.OSullivan told Newsweek that the Taylor suit is still in litigation. However, about 800 pages worth of public discovery documents and court filings led him and Nelson to sue McDonalds Corporation.

Litigation,https://www.delcotimes.com/2022/05/15/delco-grave-marker-company-allegedly-continues-to-rip-off-clients-amidst-litigation,A grave marker company already being sued by the state is allegedly continuing to do bad business,"MEDIA COURTHOUSE – An Upper Darby grave marker and engraving company that has twice been sued by the state for violations of consumer protection laws is allegedly continuing to engage in fraudulent business practices under a new name, according to a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Deputy Attorney General Debra Djupman Warring last month.“Gregory Stefan, Sr., and his family may have changed the name of their company, but they are still taking advantage of consumers in their time of grief,” said Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro in a statement. “My office filed a second lawsuit in August 2021 that asks the court to shut the Stefan family down for good. As that litigation continues, this latest filing seeks to prevent the defendants from engaging with Pennsylvania consumers and selling services related to headstones and memorials.”Deputy Attorney General Thomas J. Blessington filed the original complaint in 2015 alleging “Lifestone by Stefan,” “Stefan Memorials” and Stefan, Sr. failed to deliver services consumers contracted for, or provided items of lesser quality than advertised when delivered. The company also denied or delayed providing refunds to unhappy consumers, and falsely told some people that they were affiliated with the cemeteries where their loved ones were being buried when that was not the case, according to the prior complaint.Shapiro – a Democratic contender in the 2022 gubernatorial election – previously said his office secured a $300,000 judgment against Lifestone and an injunction against Stefan, Sr. that prevents him from owning, managing, or having any significant involvement in any business that provides or engraves headstones for consumers.Between the original complaint being filed and that injunction, however, Shapiro said Stefan and his sons, Gregory J. Stefan, Jr., and Gerard Stefan, established a new business called “1843 LLC,” which has allegedly engaged in similar business practices.Some other names the company goes by include Colonial Memorials, Stefan Memorial Group, The Memorial Company, Gallagher Memorials, Alessi Memorials, 1843 Memonals/Canledge and 1843 New Britain/Quakertown Memorials, according to Blessington.He filed the second suit in August 2021 after allegedly receiving more than 100 consumer complaints that the various companies continue to take money up-front from grieving survivors without providing contracted services.Warring’s proposed preliminary injunction, filed April 28, claims the defendants are still operating under the “Colonial Memorials” moniker and continuing to engage in the same deceptive business practices that landed them in court to begin with.“Notwithstanding the Lifestone litigation, the Stefans did not modify their practices to deal honestly and fairly with consumers; rather, they simply transitioned their operations from a company in litigation to a newly formed business,” the motion says.Warring notes that the 2015 litigation was resolved in 2018 via a consent judgment and order that required payment of consumer restitution, civil penalties and costs, but the defendants failed to honor that judgment, leading to a contempt petition.The contempt issue was resolved in 2020 through a stipulated order in which the defendants agreed to stop selling cemetery memorial products in Pennsylvania, according to the motion, but nearly four years after the entry of judgment for the original litigation, Lifestone has still not satisfied the restitution owed to consumers.Warring says Colonial is a Delaware for-profit corporation founded in February 2021 that registered to do business in Pennsylvania in April 2021. A letter from attorney Christian J. Hoey, representing the Lifestone defendants, claims Colonial was formed to “provide assistance to 1843 to eliminate its backlog of orders sold to customers,” and that neither Gregory Stefan, Jr., nor Gerald Stefan have any control over the company’s cash or finances, according to the motion.“However, the owner of Colonial is Suzanne Stefan, the wife of Gregory Stefan, Jr.,” the motion says. “Gregory Stefan, Jr. and Gerald Stefan sell cemetery memorial products for Colonial, and fees for their work are paid to 1843 LLC by Colonial.”Warring says her office has received multiple complaints regarding Colonial similar to those that consumers have lodged against the other Lifestone companies. She provided four examples of consumers who said they paid Colonial thousands of dollars for markers that have not yet been placed. One, an 80-year-old man from Langhorne, does not have the funds for a replacement marker for his deceased wife, according to motion. Others said their calls and emails to Colonial were met with silence or, in one instance, a statement that the company is short staffed and doing the best it can.“The consumer complaints against Colonial demonstrate that the wrongful conduct the commonwealth has alleged against defendants in the 1843 litigation is now continuing with 1843, Gregory Stefan, Jr., and Gerard Stefan providing services to Colonial,” the motion says. “…The commonwealth submits that the Stefans are simply continuing their pattern of moving operations from one company embroiled in litigation over to a new business.”Warring argues that the motion should be granted to prevent any additional alleged harm to the public, and because it is narrowly tailored to allow 1843 to continue delivering products already contracted for while constraining the defendants from taking on any new business.A trial in the 1843 litigation has been scheduled for later this year during a four-week trial pool beginning Nov. 3, according to the motion. Shapiro is meanwhile urging anyone who may have been harmed by 1843 LLC or its associated entities to contact his office by calling 1-800-441-2555 or online at attorneygeneral.gov/submit-a-complaint."
Litigation,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pipeline-company-pay-35-million-criminal-fines-and-civil-penalties-largest-ever-inland-spill,Pipeline Company to Pay $35 Million in Criminal Fines and Civil Penalties for Largest-Ever Inland Spill of Produced Water from Oil Drilling,"The Department of Justice today filed criminal charges under the Clean Water Act against Summit Midstream Partners LLC, a North Dakota pipeline company that discharged 29 million gallons of produced water from its pipeline near Williston, North Dakota, over the course of nearly five months in 2014-2015.The discharge of more than 700,000 barrels of “produced water” – a waste product of hydraulic fracturing – contaminated land, groundwater, and over 30 miles of tributaries of the Missouri River. The spill, believed to be the largest inland spill in history, was visible in photographs taken by satellites orbiting the earth.In addition to the criminal charges, the United States and the State of North Dakota filed a civil complaint against Summit and a related company, Meadowlark Midstream Company LLC, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act and North Dakota water pollution control laws. Under parallel settlements resolving the criminal and civil cases, the company has agreed to pay a total of $35 million in criminal fines and civil penalties.“Summit prioritized profits over the environment. The company’s disregard for pipeline safety resulted in pollution of the environment on a massive scale over 143 days,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “Summit’s conduct was criminal and its failure to immediately report the discharge a felony. This resolution holds the company financially accountable, requires enhanced compliance measures to prevent future spills, and provides compensation for North Dakota’s damaged natural resources.”“North Dakota and its federal partners are holding Summit and Meadowlark accountable and making clear that disregard for North Dakota’s environmental laws will not be tolerated,” said North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem. “The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, Game and Fish Department, and Industrial Commission staff spent countless hours investigating and responding to the spill, making this settlement possible.”If the court accepts the plea agreement, Summit will pay $15 million in federal criminal fines for negligently causing the continuous spill, failing to stop it and deliberately failing to make an immediate report as required.“Summit’s negligence included the design, construction and operation of the Marmon Water Gathering System pipeline, as well as the negligent failure to find and stop the spill after learning of objective signs of a leak,” according to a factual admission signed by the company and filed in court. Summit started pipeline operations without meters at both ends of the pipeline to conduct “line balancing” or otherwise having a reliable leak detection system in place. “Even after the company learned of major drops in pressure and volume – objective signs of a leak – the company negligently continued operations and thus caused millions of additional gallons to be discharged into U.S. waters without learning the cause or pausing operations,” according to the Joint Factual Statement.Summit has further admitted that it knowingly did not share all relevant information regarding the volume and duration of the spill and that its reports to federal and state authorities “were incomplete and misleading,” in papers filed in court. Summit eventually reported 70,000 barrels over a 10-day period despite an internal analysis showing the discharge was more than 700,000 barrels over 143 days. Under the terms of the proposed plea agreement, Summit will serve three years of probation in which comprehensive remedial measures are required.Under the proposed civil settlement, Summit, Meadowlark, and a third related company, Summit Operating Services Company LLC, will pay $20 million in civil penalties, perform comprehensive injunctive relief, clean up the contamination caused by the spill and pay $1.25 million in natural resource damages to resolve the civil case. Summit has spent over $50 million to date to clean up the spill under state oversight; ongoing remediation efforts under the civil settlement are expected to continue over the next several years. The civil settlement further requires Summit and Meadowlark to take concrete steps to prevent future discharges, including stringent pipeline installation, operation, and testing requirements; a centralized computational pipeline monitoring system; spill response planning and countermeasures; an environmental management system; and data management and training measures. Independent third-party audits are required to ensure that certain injunctive measures are properly developed and implemented. These compliance measures were made a condition of Summit’s probation in the proposed criminal plea agreement. The companies have also agreed to enter into a related administrative settlement with the North Dakota Industrial Commission.Summit continued pumping produced water through the pipeline in 2014 to 2015 despite multiple warning signs that the line had ruptured:Aug. 17, 2014. Real-time pressure data collected by Summit showed a significant pressure drop, indicating a rupture had occurred.Oct. 14, 2014: Summit’s construction manager raised a concern about “extreme low pressure on the pipeline.” The facilities engineer responded: “Not good. We may want to consider shutting it down.” Summit continued to operate the line.Nov. 4, 2014: the third-party operator of the injection well at the end of the pipeline (Company A) informed Summit that 115,000 barrels (4,830,000 gallons) of produced water were missing for the month of October, which is approximately 3,700 barrels (155,400 gallons) per day.Dec. 3, 10, and 16, 2014: Company A followed up with Summit about the produced water discrepancy, having received no response to its previous inquiries. During this time, Company A confirmed the accuracy of its injection well meters and informed Summit that the discrepancy had risen to 4,900 barrels per day.Jan. 6, 2015: A Summit employee walked the line, finally identifying the rupture.The resulting 700,000-barrel discharge of produced water contained crude oil, chloride, sodium, ammonia, aluminum, arsenic, boron, copper, nickel, selenium, zinc, barium, benzene and thallium, among other contaminants. Produced water is a waste product of oil extraction and can be toxic to plants, fish and other aquatic wildlife. It is also harmful to humans.The designated federal trustee is the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service, and the designated state trustees are the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality and the North Dakota Department of Game and Fish.

Although employees complained about the hostile work environ­ment, the company did not address the harassment. Instead, Giertsen assigned one of the employees who complained to more physically demanding work and then fired him as retaliation, the EEOC said.Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace due to race and retaliation against an employee for complaining about the discrimination. The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, EEOC v. Giertsen Company of Wisconsin, Civil Action No. 21-cv-1130, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.In addition to obtaining $140,000 in monetary relief for the aggrieved individuals, the settlement provides equitable relief for Giertsen employees, including training and appointment of an equal employment opportunity officer, who will be responsible for handling any future discrimination complaints at the company.“Employers cannot allow their employees to be subjected to racial slurs and comments,” said Wendy Martin, area director of the EEOC’s Milwaukee Area Office. “Such conduct must not be tolerated in the workplace.”EEOC Chicago District Director Julianne Bowman reminded companies, “It is unlawful for a company to knowingly ignore race-based harassment. The EEOC will continue to hold employers accountable when they fail to meet their obligations.”Gregory Gochanour, the EEOC’s regional attorney in Chicago, added, “The law requires employers to take complaints of race harassment seriously and act swiftly to address such conduct in the workplace. We acknowledge Giertsen’s cooperation in the early resolution of this lawsuit and look forward to working with the company to ensure the workplace is free of harassment in the future.”The EEOC’s Milwaukee Area Office is part of the Chicago District, which is responsible for processing charges of discrimin­ation, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota.

Litigation,https://www.fastcompany.com/90747572/redfin-to-pay-4-million-to-settle-lawsuit-over-digital-redlining,Redfin to pay $4 million to settle lawsuit over digital redlining,"For prospective homebuyers, the online search portal and real estate brokerage Redfin is a go-to resource. Listings in more than 100 housing markets in the United States and Canada can be browsed easily, and a monthly average of more than 47 million users did so in 2021, according to the company’s annual report.advertisementadvertisementBut in certain markets, search results had a big caveat. Redfin would show the listings, but due to what it called a “minimum price limit,” the company declined to make the full range of its services available—including real estate agents, professional photos, and promotion. That disproportionately affected homes in non-white areas. “That policy resulted in Redfin predominantly not providing services in Black and Latino areas and predominantly offering services in white areas,” says Morgan Williams, general counsel of the National Fair Housing Alliance. For example, in the majority-minority city of Chicago, the minimum price threshold was set at $400,000, while in neighboring DuPage County, the threshold was just $275,000. In the majority-Black city of Detroit, the minimum price was $700,000, while outside city borders that limit was just $250,000. Redfin defended this policy, arguing that limiting its activities by price is the only fair way for the company to operate profitably. Along with nine fair housing organizations across the country, NFHA sued Redfin in October 2020 to stop this practice, alleging that “Redfin’s policies and practices operate as a discriminatory stranglehold on communities of color.” In a settlement announced Friday, Redfin has pledged to do away with its minimum price limits and pay $4 million to the plaintiffs. Given Redfin’s reach, this is one of the most significant fair housing settlements in recent years.advertisementadvertisementThe problem, as detailed in a 2020 investigation by NFHA, was, in effect, a modern version of redlining, the racist lending and housing market policies of postwar United States that effectively segregated neighborhoods and blocked many communities of color from homeownership in general. NFHA’s investigation mapped out the properties in cities like Baltimore, Detroit, and Kansas City where Redfin declined services due to its price threshold. The maps show high concentrations of these listings in ZIP codes with large non-white populations, while serviced listings were disproportionately located in ZIP codes with larger white populations. NFHA and its coplaintiffs argue that these differences in service offerings are a continuation of decades-old hurdles that have prevented communities of color from buying homes and creating generational wealth. “Securing real estate services is a component of the process of buying a home, and barriers to securing real estate services operate as barriers to that process,” Williams says. “A minimum home value policy serves to restrict the kind of opportunity for wealth generation . . . to those communities that have long been redlined.” Redfin objects to the characterization of its minimum price limit as redlining. “Describing a price-based policy as redlining is sensationalistic and wrong because Redfin serves all neighborhoods in the metro areas where we operate,” a company spokesperson tells Fast Company. “We do not make service determinations based on race or the demographics of the neighborhood. Home price is the only fair and objective way to make that determination because home price determines the fees we earn.”advertisementThe spokesperson says that unlike other real estate brokerages, Redfin employs all of its 2,400 real estate agents as full-time, salaried employees with benefits, and the minimum price thresholds it used were tools to ensure agents could operate profitably. After the lawsuit was filed, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman sent an email to employees, later published on the company’s blog, objecting to the suit. For now, that price-based approach, along with its effects on certain neighborhoods, will be put on hold. As part of the settlement with NFHA and its coplaintiffs, Redfin agreed to eliminate minimum price thresholds for five years, and present its employees and agents with fair housing training developed by NFHA. Redfin retains the right to pass along prospective homebuyers to agents in partner organizations in some instances. The settlement highlights the increasing role technology is playing in the housing market, and the issues it can raise. Another recent real estate controversy erupted when a tweaked algorithm led the online homebuying platform Zillow into overpaying for homes, causing ripple effects in some housing markets and losing the company an estimated $330 million in a single quarter. This kind of systematic decision-making is beginning to change the way homes are valued and, in the case of Redfin, whether home sales in certain areas merit the time of a real estate agent. (Redfin’s dynamic price thresholds are adjusted manually by local managers.) The consequences—unintended but still discriminatory—perpetuate the kinds of barriers that have limited the ability of some communities to access fair housing.advertisementSays Williams: “Challenging these kinds of policies and encouraging enhanced awareness about how different algorithmic-based systems may result in discriminatory outputs is really important for us moving forward in solving this problem of the racial wealth gap.”"
Litigation,https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/local/buena-officials-meet-in-private-about-landisville-fire-company-litigation/article_bd1774ee-db6c-11ec-a759-d3df8ea95064.html,Buena officials meet in private about Landisville fire company litigation,"The Borough Council last week held a lengthy closed session to discuss litigation that pits the borough and the Minotola Volunteer Fire Company against the Landisville Volunteer Fire Company.After returning to its chambers, council entertained a motion for the borough to drop the lawsuit, but ultimately decided to pull the motion.Members of council left open the possibility that they may hold a special meeting sometime before the next scheduled meeting June 13 to further discuss the issue.The council voted unanimously in July 2021 to dissolve Buena Fire District No. 1, a municipal entity that had historically been served by the 100-year-old Landisville fire company.The territory and responsibilities of Fire District No. 1 were to be taken over by Buena Fire District No. 2, which is served by the Minotola fire company.Buena Borough Hall set to reopen after flooding BUENA — Four months after flooding shut down Borough Hall, Buena is beginning to create more…The borough and Fire District No. 2 have since sued the Landisville company and former Fire District No. 1 commissioners. The plaintiffs say the Landisville company failed to turn over certain property as prescribed by borough ordinance. Landisville supporters maintain the plaintiffs have received what they need, and that outstanding property still belongs to the private Landisville company, rather than the dissolved public district.The dissolution and lawsuit have galvanized an ongoing opposition campaign against the then members of council. Two were unseated in the November election, and two people who voted for the dissolution are being challenged in the June 7 Republican primary.Council member Jorge Alvarez, who had seconded the motion, said he would be willing to vote in favor of dropping the suit if the Landisville litigants, many of whom were in the approximately 20-person audience May 23, agreed to resolve the dispute outside of litigation.“We’re asking that we meet and end this thing, let’s get it done,” Alvarez said. “Let’s come to an agreement as adults and more as residents, because we’re residents.”“This has to end, this has to be done tonight,” Council President Matthew Walker, who made the motion, said earlier.Some people involved in the litigation said they did not want to meet about the case without first talking with their lawyers. Others in the audience said the underlying cause of the lawsuit would have to be addressed, namely the dissolution of Fire District No. 1.Buena Borough Hall closed due to flooding BUENA — People hoping for a smooth start to 2022 for borough government have had their hopes…In response to the reluctance of people to meet on the spot after the meeting, the motion was pulled. Alvarez and Walker still met with some supporters of the Landisville company after the meeting to discuss resolving the situation and the possibility of holding a special meeting to take further action on the matter.Borough Solicitor Angela Costigan disputed that the motion on the floor was to drop the lawsuit and that the motion was instead to “meet and discuss.” She later said the council president had made a “request” to which Alvarez “agreed.”Walker, when he seemingly made the motion, had begun by saying “I want to make a resolution that we drop the lawsuit and that we bring all the parties to the table,” to which Alvarez replied, “and I second that.”Costigan also noted that the litigation involved not only the borough but also Fire District No. 2, which is a separate municipal entity, meaning the borough does not have the power to end all legal action by itself.Council member Joseph D’Alessandro III said he was concerned about how dropping the lawsuit would affect the borough’s ability to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to the firefighters of the former Fire District No. 1. He said the litigation would allow Fire District No. 2 to obtain records pertaining to Landisville firefighters’ Length of Service Award Program, or LOSAP, so they could receive their payments. Landisville officials have argued that Fire District No. 2 already has the documents it needs to distribute LOSAP funds. D’Alessandro added the borough also had to enforce its ordinance, which he said mandated that transfer of property still in Landisville’s possession go to Fire District No. 2.Council members Patricia and Gina Andaloro, a mother-daughter pair and the two Democrats on the council, were excluded from much of the closed session to avoid creating the perception of conflict of interest. Patricia Andaloro is named as a defendant in the lawsuit due to her stint as a Fire District No. 1 commissioner. Some residents took issue with Gina Andaloro’s exclusion from the closed session, saying her familial relationship did not create a conflict of interest.Members of the council who voted to dissolve Fire District No. 1 in July 2021 have argued dissolution was warranted by code violations. The borough and the state Office of Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health conducted investigations that uncovered more than two dozen code violations at the Landisville company.Supporters of the fire company have argued the dissolution was unfair. They noted that Landisville passed a state inspection in June 2021 after the investigations were completed and before council voted to dissolve.The dissolution seemingly precipitated a swell of political action against the July 2021 members of council. Then Council President Rosalie Baker and then Council member Joseph Mancuso Jr., running as Republican incumbents, were defeated in the November election by the Andaloros, a remarkable outcome given Baker’s approximately 30-year career on the governing body and the overall tilt of the New Jersey 2021 elections toward the GOP. Supporters of the company attributed the outcome in part to outrage over the dissolution of Fire District No. 1.The June 7 Republican primary election will see Baker and D’Alessandro running against three newcomers — Douglas Adams, Mariana Barsuglia and Joseph Fabrizio. Of the three newcomers, Fabrizio is running unopposed for the GOP nomination to fill a one-year unexpired term of a vacant seat on the council. Of the remaining four candidates, the two who obtain the highest vote totals will win the GOP nomination to fill two full-term seats on the council."

The complaint alleges Lasky has “repeatedly threatened to air Pisor’s ‘dirty laundry,’” in regards to “alleged conduct that happened years ago… unless Pisor agreed to accept a below-market buyout from Lasky.” Lasky is listed as the sole defendant.Friday’s court hearing concerned Pisor’s request for a temporary restraining order that would allow him back into the restaurants, as well as undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages, since he is suffering “monetary damages and irreparable harm in the form of loss of reputation, loss of goodwill, and loss of current and or future restaurant opportunities.”“We’re here basically with a business divorce case,” Jade Lambert, one of Pisor’s attorneys, said at the hearing. “But we need to put some process around this and take the heat out of it.”She added: “Mr. Lasky no longer wants to be in business with Mr. Pisor, the problem is he’s going about it totally the wrong way, in violation of the party’s operating agreement.”Judge Clare Quish denied Pisor’s request, saying that his legal team hadn’t demonstrated an emergency need. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, April 29.In court, Lasky’s attorney, Doug Wexler, told Quish that What If’s HR department was investigating an incident involving Pisor and marketing director Molly Currey. A police report filed by Currey on March 11 claims PIsor made two early morning visits to her Logan Square residence, at 4:28 a.m. and again around 6:30 a.m., when he knocked on her front and back doors and called her name.Police did not follow up on the incident, but Currey, via a company memo, told her coworkers Pisor had repeatedly called her and texted her that morning and set her dogs barking and alarm ringing. Currey says she is now “afraid of him” after dealing with a series of “verbally abusive and aggressive behavior” through the years. A February 10 office exchange between the two brought her to tears, according to an affidavit filed by Lasky’s defense team.In court, the parties admitted to negotiating Pisor’s exit, but Pisor’s attorneys want to speed up the process and return his access to What If’s facilities. In court, Wexler said he’d be happy to return Pisor’s computer “as a going-away present.” He painted Pisor as an absentee owner. An affidavit from executive chef Danny Grant claimed Pisor wasn’t doing his job during the pandemic and that he had checked out and “drank all day.”These accounts had no bearing on Judge Quish’s decision to deny the temporary restraining order. The judge said the police report and affidavits were categorized as “unverified banter,” and that she would only consider whether the operating agreement was violated and Lasky had legal grounds to oust Pisor.Maple & Ash was hailed as a fresh approach to the traditionally stuffy steakhouse when it opened in 2015. The lawsuit credits Pisor with conceiving the idea and securing funding for the venture, which replaced Hunt Club, a nightclub that had lost both its edge and popularity since Lasky opened it in 1996. Hunt Club was torn down in 2013.Lasky, Pisor, and Grant opened a second Maple & Ash in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2019. A year prior, the more casual Etta debuted in Bucktown; a Scottsdale location is also debuting next week. Since Etta’s debut, What If has also opened chic Italian eatery Monarch and sake bar Kessaku in Dallas, along with rooftop restaurant Celestina in Culver City, California (where there’s another Etta location). Another new concept, Cafe Sophie, is planned for Chicago later this month. Another Maple & Ash is also pegged for Beverly Hills, California.According to the lawsuit, Lasky, Pisor, and Grant each own a 31 percent stake in the company with Lasky and Pisor considered “capital members,” meaning that, “all management decisions and actions require the approval of both Lasky and Pisor.” Revenue for What If has climbed from $35 million in 2019 to a projected $180 to $200 million for 2022.In a statement sent after Friday’s hearing, Lazar Raynal, one of Pisor’s attorneys, reiterated that “none of these allegations were raised, to our knowledge, before Mr. Lasky proposed a buy-out on March 10. Mr. Lasky is now using this as a pretext to force Mr. Pisor out... We believe that, in the wake of the company’s recent valuation, Mr. Lasky is acting out of greed.”Raynal also characterized Pisor as being upset on March 10 when he tried to visit Currey. After learning “he was being pushed out of the company he’d built, Mr. Pisor went to the home of someone he believed was a friend — someone he had hired and known for 15 years. Mr. Pisor’s conduct was legal, and the police took no action as a result of the complaint.”Prior to Friday’s hearing, What If issued a brief statement: “At this time, the company will not comment on a meritless and frivolous lawsuit.”"
Litigation,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2022/05/13/667552.htm,"Strems, Adjusters, Restoration Firm Settle Florida Citizens Lawsuit for $1M","New You can now listen to Insurance Journal articles!A now-suspended Miami lawyer, along with the successor to his law firm, a public claims adjuster and a restoration company, have agreed to pay a total of $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Citizens Property Insurance Corp. that had accused the defendants of fraud in hundreds of insurance claims.The settlement is far less than what Citizens, Florida’s largest property insurer, had initially sought from attorney Scot Strems and his co-defendants. But officials said it should help deter other bad actors in a fraud-plagued Florida litigation environment.“This settlement certainly accomplishes what we set out to do, which was to seek justice for what we saw as an egregious fraud and to expose the threat of this type of activity,” said Joseph Theobald, senior director of Citizens’ special investigations unit.The settlement, announced Thursday, is the latest development in what Florida insurers have called widespread, coordinated deception and exaggeration in assignment-of-benefits claims, which have reportedly cost carriers millions of dollars. Citizens filed the suit in 2020. That was about the same time that the Florida Bar moved to suspend Strems for violating numerous Bar rules, including filing thousands of lawsuits against insurers, many of them on the same claim. Strems’ suspension from practice is due to end later this year.Also named in the suit and settlement are Contender Claims Consultants in Miami and its principal Guillermo Saavedra; and All Insurance Restoration Services and company leaders Cesar Guerrero and Derek Parsons.Florida’s chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, said the settlement and the investigations that led to it were significant.“Had this fraud been left unchecked, it could have cost policyholders $16 million a year,” Patronis said in a statement. “As criminal investigations continue, this action sends a loud signal that if you’re ripping off customers, we’re going to find you and hold you accountable.”Patronis did not say what he based the $16 million figure on, but a Citizens spokesman said that the Strems law firm was responsible for as much as $112 million in questionable claims and litigation filed from 2015 to 2020.The Strems firm closed in 2020 and most of its attorneys formed a new firm known as The Property Advocates. A lawyer for Strems and the new firm said Thursday that the $1 million settlement was a pittance compared to the $65 million that Citizens had demanded early in the legal process and that it did not cover the insurer’s investigative and legal costs. The defendants agreed to settle in order to limit further expenses and to move on, said attorney William Schifino Jr., of Tampa.“This is not a victory for Citizens by any stretch of the imagination,” Schifino said.He noted that at a 2021 hearing, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman, the same judge who is overseeing a $1 billion settlement in the Champlain Towers condominium collapse, questioned the sagacity of Citizens proceeding with the lawsuit.“I would strongly encourage Citizens, before it requires the taxpayers to fund this litigation much longer, that it seriously explore potential resolution, given the limited nature of the funds that may be available as well as the legal obstacles to this claim,” the judge said, according to an official transcript of the hearing that Schifino provided to the Insurance Journal.Citizens’ spokesman Michael Peltier pointed out that Citizens is not funded through taxes, but through premiums paid by policyholders. Florida law requires that the insurer levy additional assessments on policyholders only if it experiences a deficit in the wake of catastrophic losses.Schifino said that Citizens’ years-long investigation “was proving to be very expensive to Citizens,” but had produced little evidence against his clients. he said.Citizens said its investigative unit began digging into the Strems firm in 2016, after seeing suspicious patterns in claims and claims litigation. Investigators sifted through more than 5,000 claims and found that many of them followed a similar track, Peltier explained: Most were filed within 45 days after a loss; multiple claims were filed at the same time; claims were filed after repairs had been completed and after an AOB agreement had been signed; the same plumber, water mitigation company and adjuster were usually used; and boiler-plate plumbing invoices were used in some cases.Citizens sent about 400 cases to the Department of Financial Services’ Division of Investigative and Forensic Services, which initiated its own investigation. In 2020, Citizens went ahead with its lawsuit, alleging that the defendants had formed an illicit enterprise, all working together to defraud insurers. The enterprise violated state and federal anti-racketeering laws, created false invoices and inflated the cost of claims, mostly on non-weather water damage, the suit charged.The alleged fraud usually began with a Contender adjuster promising free home remodels to homeowners, the lawsuit’s 392-page amended complaint reads. Once inside the home, “Contender sheds its public adjuster duties” and begins working for the enterprise to manufacture claims and damages.“Contender convinces homeowners to provide intake data and sign an agreement on a (computer) tablet to help adjust their claims,” the complaint reads. “In truth, however, Contender is serving as an unlawful law firm agent to solicit clients for Strems Law Firm, and as a feeder to AIRS (All Insurance Restoration Services). The tablets point to hirestremslaw.com, which was designed to create retainer agreements between the homeowners and Strems Law Firm, without any discussion with the law firm or any attorney.”In answers to the complaint, the defendants denied wrongdoing.The DFS’s own investigation into Strems, Contender Claims Consultants and another law firm appeared to be making progress in recent years, despite a lack of cooperation from defendants. Agency investigators subpoenaed records from Contender and others, but the defendants refused to comply, according to court records. In 2021, a circuit court judge essentially ordered Contender to comply.Then, In September last year, DFS appeared to drop the pursuit of the records. Agency officials said they couldn’t discuss the reason why but said an investigation was still underway. Schifino said he was not familiar with the DFS investigation, and DFS officials were not available late Thursday.Citizens’ leaders did not say how the defendants in the civil suit would share the burden of paying the $1 million settlement, or if it has been paid. The case was dismissed in late March after the settlement was formalized, which suggests that the payment has been made, Schifino said. It was unclear why the settlement was not announced sooner.Principals with the adjusting firm and the restoration firm and their attorneys could not be reached for comment Thursday.Topics Lawsuits Florida"
Litigation,https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/04/25/litigation-risks-posed-by-greenwashing-claims-for-esg-funds/,Litigation Risks Posed by “Greenwashing” Claims for ESG Funds,"IntroductionThe massive flow of assets into ESG-focused funds reflects the intense and growing demand for investment products that enable investors to put their values into action while pursuing strong financial returns in their portfolios. The dramatic growth of the ESG funds sector has predictably attracted the attention of regulators, commentators and the private plaintiffs’ bar. The SEC’s Division of Enforcement last year formed a Climate and ESG Task Force to, among other things, “analyze disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers’ and funds’ ESG strategies” and ESG related issues have moved to the forefront of exams conducted of registered investment advisers. States have similarly demonstrated an increased focus on ESG regulations: a dozen state attorneys general, including those of California and New York, sent a letter to the SEC last year that called for increased ESG-related disclosures for climate-related financial risks by “all SEC-regulated firms.” Notably, foreign regulators have been ahead of their U.S. counterparts in focusing on ESG disclosures; in particular, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) in the European Union will require disclosure of ESG considerations by all funds. The head of the SEC’s Climate and ESG Task Force has emphasized that its review of ESG fund disclosures and marketing materials will be guided by “long-standing principles of materiality and disclosure” in assessing potential violations of the securities laws or advisers’ fiduciary duties.The growing ESG fund sector has also been the subject of recent public criticism from various quarters, particularly claims of greenwashing leveled against climate-focused funds, from media outlets including Time, USA Today, The Economist, Reclaim Finance, and Responsible Investor. According to the sponsors of a number of published studies, like As You Sow, InfluenceMap, and Morningstar, many funds with a sustainable or “green” investment thesis are not living up to their names and promises, because their portfolio holdings are not sufficiently aligned with specified standards for addressing climate change. Indeed, SEC Chair Gary Gensler published a video on March 1, 2022 in which he expressed skepticism about whether many ESG-focused funds live up to their names, asserting that the investing public does not have sufficient information to evaluate ESG funds. In his video, Mr. Gensler asserts that the process for selecting an ESG fund should be as straightforward as purchasing a carton of milk labelled fat-free and suggests that he would cause the SEC to pursue new disclosure rules for ESG-focused funds.For its part, the private plaintiffs’ bar has initiated a number of actions asserting greenwashing claims, although the focus of these claims to date has not been ESG funds, but rather allegations that operating companies, including corporations in the oil and gas, mining, and consumer goods sectors, are making misleading claims about the climate-friendliness of their operations or the products they manufacture. See, e.g., Jochims v. Oatly Group AB, 1:21-cv-06360 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2021) (order granting motion to dismiss claims that an oat milk company made materially false and misleading statements about the company’s sustainability); In re Vale S.A. Sec. Litig., 2020 WL 2610979, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. May 20, 2020) (alleging securities law claims that a mining accident demonstrated a Brazilian mining company’s sustainability and safety claims were misleading); Ramirez v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 334 F. Supp. 3d 832 (N.D. Tex. 2018) (denying a motion to dismiss claims that Exxon made material misstatements about proxy costs for carbon).What do these trends mean for litigation exposure faced by ESG funds and their advisers and boards? Specifically, can we anticipate that private plaintiffs’ lawyers and securities regulators will fix their sights on ESG funds, embracing the greenwashing criticism by public commentators as a basis for launching a wave of securities fraud litigation and enforcement actions? Not necessarily. For a number of reasons, assertions that climate-focused ESG funds are “not as green as they should be” may prove challenging for the plaintiffs’ bar in establishing valid securities law claims in the fund context. ESG fund disclosures differ in fundamental ways from the ESG disclosures of typical operating companies. In light of these differences, as well as established securities law principles governing fund litigation, the types of theories recently asserted against operating companies will not be readily transportable to the ESG fund setting, as discussed below.How ESG Fund Disclosures are DifferentUnder current SEC rules, the prescribed ESG-related disclosures of operating companies are fairly narrow in scope. For investors, the principal ESG-related disclosure focus area is climate risk, although there also are disclosure requirements and/or guidance specific to conflict minerals, resource extraction, mine safety, board diversity, human capital, pay ratio and cybersecurity. Today, environmental disclosures largely are pursuant to the SEC’s general principles-based disclosure framework and grounded in materiality. As the SEC explained in its 2010 Interpretive Guidance on Disclosures Related to Climate Change, these disclosure obligations under the 1933 and 1934 Acts primarily relate to the potential impact on the company of climate change and regulatory developments to address climate change. In the last several months, the SEC has sought to encourage enhanced climate-risk disclosure consistent with the current disclosure framework by publishing a sample comment letter on this topic and commenting on climate-related disclosures in selected public filings. Required climate-risk disclosures are poised to increase, with the SEC proposing new climate-related disclosure rules on March 21, 2022, which will require increased reporting on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions, climate risks, the impact of those risks on financials, and management of and strategies to mitigate those risks.A large number of public companies also make substantial voluntary sustainability and corporate social responsibility disclosures—these go well beyond those required by SEC rules—on their websites and/or in stand-alone “corporate social responsibility” (CSR) or “corporate sustainability” reports. These disclosures increasingly include both historical quantitative metrics and forward-looking targets and are aligned with third party frameworks. Many companies also voluntarily submit environmental and other information to third party rankers and raters.In the operating company context, allegations of greenwashing are most likely to assert that the company has over-stated the climate-friendliness or other positive impact of its operations, products, or initiatives—such as the carbon footprint of its products or the impact of projects it would finance with a “green bond.” From a securities liability exposure perspective, with the increase in quantitative ESG disclosures, these types of representations will increasingly be susceptible to measurement and verification, and could have a readily-provable impact on the company’s share price if shown to be over-stated.By contrast, ESG funds, like all registered investment companies, are subject to a different set of prescribed disclosure requirements than operating companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other securities laws. For example, the new proposed SEC rules will apply to public operating companies but not registered funds, although the SEC may propose additional rules targeting registered funds in the future. Registered ESG funds include open-end mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and a relatively small number of closed-end funds. As of 2020, the ICI identified 592 ESG-focused mutual funds and ETFs with assets of $465 billion. In 2021 alone, 38 funds with sustainability mandates were launched in the U.S., 29 of which were equity funds and 25 were ETFs.In their required public disclosures, registered ESG funds describe their investment objective (typically a combination of financial return objectives and incorporation of stated ESG principles in security selection), the investment approach fund managers will take in seeking to achieve those objectives (i.e., the process they will follow in building a portfolio of securities that will provide investment returns and further the fund’s stated ESG principles), and the risks that may affect their ability to meet these combined objectives. Significantly, as required by law, registered funds also regularly disclose their full portfolio holdings. Open-end mutual funds must disclose their portfolio holdings at the end of each fiscal quarter, while ETFs are required to disclose their portfolio holdings each day. 17 C.F.R. § 270.30b1-5 (requiring registered management investment companies to file each quarter form N-Q, which discloses the fund’s portfolio holdings); 17 C.F.R. § 270.6c-11(c)(1) (describing ETF portfolio holdings disclosure requirements). The types of representations that have been the focus of greenwashing litigation against operating companies are not the types of statements that funds historically have had a basis or reason to make.For example, unlike an operating company that might tout the environmental sustainability of its business model and disclose greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and a net zero commitment, a climate-focused fund is more likely to explain how its investment process weights the relative carbon impact—as well as the relative financial performance—of the companies it considers for the portfolio. In describing its investment process, a fund will often disclose the industry classifications and research services its adviser utilizes in making ESG-focused investing determinations, or, alternatively, the metrics and criteria the adviser has developed in-house. From a securities liability perspective, it would be challenging for a shareholder-plaintiff to plausibly allege—at least based on typical fund litigation evidence like portfolio holdings or performance results—material misrepresentations in such process descriptions.Moreover, ESG funds vary significantly from one another in the approach they take to incorporate ESG principles into their investment process. As part of an ongoing industry-wide effort in the U.S. to standardize terminology for registered funds, industry groups have proposed some basic categories of investment approach. These efforts appear to be coalescing around three categories described by the Investment Company Institute (ICI) as “ESG exclusionary,” “ESG inclusionary” and “Impact.” ESG exclusionary funds exclude companies or sectors that fail to meet certain criteria or that do not align with the fund’s objectives, such as categorical prohibitions on industries like weapons manufacturing, gambling, alcohol or fossil fuels. Conversely, ESG inclusionary funds actively pursue positive sustainability-related outcomes and financial performance through a focused investment thesis that tilts their portfolios according to the relevant ESG factors—without necessarily excluding particular sectors. Funds pursuing impact investing strategies seek to generate positive, measurable, and reportable ESG impacts alongside a financial return, often including through activism in the operating companies in which they invest; these impact funds are defined by their measurement, management and reporting of these impacts.These categories closely track those published by the UK Investments Association and the Institute of International Finance; in contrast, some industry participants have suggested further breakdown of these categories with additional labels like “limiting ESG risk” and “seeking ESG opportunity,” or the inclusion of categories that identify funds that utilize “corporate engagement & shareholder action,” “norms-based screening,” and “sustainability themed/thematic investing.” Thus, even among ESG funds, there can be substantial variation in the types of disclosures made, given the variation in funds’ approaches to incorporating ESG principles in their investment processes and the funds’ ESG and investment goals.By way of example, an “ESG Exclusionary” sustainable equity fund might explain that its investment process seeks to screen out of the portfolio all oil and gas companies and other companies engaged heavily in fossil fuel production or heavy use, such as utilities. An “ESG Inclusionary” sustainable fund might explain the relative weighting given to oil and gas companies in the portfolio based on their progress towards reducing their net carbon impact (while not excluding them outright). An “Impact” fund might explain its objective to invest primarily in companies whose products will have a measurable positive impact on the environment (while not necessarily excluding any types of companies). Similarly, an “ESG bond fund” might take an Exclusionary approach, declining to invest in any bond issued by oil, gas or utility companies, whereas a green bond fund with an Inclusionary or Impact approach might consider a bond of a high-emitting company if the project financed by the bond appeared likely to bring about net reductions in emissions.How Greenwashing Assertions About ESG Funds Can Miss the PointAssertions of “greenwashing” by ESG funds need to account for what funds are actually required to—and consistently do—disclose, and the variations in how different funds pursue sustainability objectives alongside financial returns. Recent published assertions of greenwashing attempt to apply one-size-fits-all metrics to funds which fail to account for these differing investment approaches. These assertions are often based on a flawed premise: they grade how “green” a fund’s holdings are, as measured by the grader’s selected yardstick, rather than assess whether the fund is managed consistent with the manner described in its prospectus and other disclosures—the appropriate metric under the securities laws.Such studies ignore the fundamental fact that different sustainable-focused funds have very different investment approaches to meet different investor preferences, and attempting to rank these funds on a single-variable margin of “greenness” is not only misleading to the investing public, it also has no basis under the securities laws. A shareholder asserting a securities law claim against a fund must plausibly allege that the fund’s disclosures contained material misstatements or omissions that would mislead a reasonable investor about the nature of the fund, its investment approach, or the risks that the fund might not meet its objectives, in light of the total mix of information available to the investor about the fund. In assessing claims of misleading disclosures, courts will recognize that the total mix of information available includes the description of the fund’s specific approach to incorporating ESG factors (e.g., exclusionary vs. inclusionary) and the fund’s regular disclosure of the securities it holds.One recent example is particularly instructive in demonstrating what can be missed in attempting to compare ESG investment products that might have varying and divergent investment approaches by design. A recent report authored by University of California, San Diego business students and sponsored by As You Sow (AYS), a non-profit shareholder advocacy organization, sought to develop and apply a simplified analysis for identifying alleged greenwashing by ESG investment products. The report examined 94 mutual funds and ETFs with “ESG” in their name. It sought to use natural language processing to analyze the use of key words in certain sections of the funds’ prospectuses and then compared how those words were used to the ESG grade that AYS assigned to each fund for a number of ESG categories; AYS’s ESG ratings give funds a grade of A through F in categories including Fossil Free Funds, Gender Equality Funds, Weapon Free Funds, Tobacco Free Funds, and Prison Free Funds. The report found that it could not differentiate between language used by “good” ESG funds—ones that received all C or higher grades across all metrics relied upon by AYS—and the language used by “bad” funds—ones that received at least one D or F grade.Significantly, however, AYS’s “good” and “bad” fund ratings in each category are based on scorecards that look primarily to fund holdings in a number of categories, regardless of whether the fund actually claims to avoid holdings in those categories as part of its stated investment approach. The Fossil Free Funds rating, for example, is based on the aggregate percentage of the fund’s holdings in companies identified by a handful of outside organizations as oil, gas and coal producers, owners of carbon reserves, and large consumers of fossil fuels (e.g., utilities). The ratings do not otherwise examine the funds’ investment strategies, sustainability objectives, or approaches to achieving those objectives.At most, this grading system could assess the success of funds with an exclusionary approach in screening out companies considered to be non-green investments using a specified metric. However, it cannot accurately capture the truthfulness of an inclusionary fund that seeks to supplement traditional energy investments with alternative, renewable sources; nor would it reflect the intentions of an impact investing fund that seeks to leverage its ownership in a corporation to promote positive change from within. Put simply, not every “green” fund must be fully divested of fossil fuel-related stocks in order to comply with its stated and disclosed investment objectives. And even within the realm of exclusionary funds, such a reductionist ranking cannot properly consider the specific criteria identified by that fund as necessitating exclusion. Instead, any analysis of a fund’s ESG success must be based on the disclosures made to the public regarding its own objectives and whether they have been met.Notwithstanding the lack of basis in the securities law standards, claims like AYS’s of widespread “greenwashing” in the fund industry could trigger the plaintiffs’ bar to launch a wave of costly meritless litigation and ultimately be counterproductive for the sustainable investment movement.Tellingly, the report concluded that “the linguistic pattern of the prospectus of the fund has a relatively low correlation with its ESG rating”—in other words, the study’s AI-based language analysis of fund disclosures was inconclusive. Nevertheless, media reporting on the study described it as finding that “60 of 94 ESG funds failed to adhere closely to the principles of environmental, social and governance investing.”This dissonance between the report’s clear statement of inconclusive results and the media’s interpretation of the report highlight the dangers of unsupported claims of greenwashing based on inconclusive or misdirected analyses. The news media amplify the message that ESG funds are somehow misleading investors, but fail to engage with the underlying claims—thus ignoring one-dimensional grading systems and the less-than-rigorous methodologies.In a similar vein, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s March 1, 2022 video, published on Twitter as part of his “Office Hours with Gary Gensler” series, lumps ESG funds into a single category, treating them all as synonymous with “green,” “sustainable,” or “carbon-neutral” funds. He suggests that selecting an ESG fund should be more like selecting “fat-free” milk at a grocery store, where the grams of fat, an objective measurement, can easily be ascertained by looking at the nutrition facts on the carton. But according to Chair Gensler, in the context of ESG investing, “there is currently a wide range of what asset managers might mean by certain terms, and what criteria they might use.” He therefore concludes: “It is easy to tell if milk is fat-free, it might be time to make it easier to tell whether a fund is really what they say they are.”Chair Gensler’s simple analogy ignores the many different ways that ESG funds can pursue their goals and the range of investor values these products seek to represent. Unlike fat-free milk, for which the truthfulness of that descriptor can be ascertained by looking at one line on a nutrition label, ESG funds cannot be evaluated or compared based on a single, objective metric. ESG investors are not “shopping” for a uniform type of product that can be compared and thus “labeled” based on a single component like grams of fat. Just as grocery customers select differing baskets of goods based on their various tastes and dietary needs (not just on fat content), so too ESG fund investors come to the market with widely varying values and financial goals they wish to see represented in their investment baskets. Allowing for a variety of different ESG products that pursue ESG objectives in different ways provides investors with numerous options to meet their distinct goals. This is no different from how the fund sector has long offered funds with widely varying investment objectives and strategies to meet the varying financial goals and risk tolerances of the investing public.Additional Challenges Facing Greenwashing Claims under the Securities LawsAside from broad assertions of widespread greenwashing across the ESG funds sector in studies like AYS’s, the discussion above highlights the challenges posed by asserting securities violations based on such theories—even if focused on a single fund—when applying established principles from fund-related securities law authority.It would be difficult in most cases to plausibly allege a materially misleading misstatement or omission in a fund disclosure on the theory that a “green” fund is not “green enough.” Plaintiff-shareholders claiming to have been misled are deemed to have read a fund’s full disclosures, and must explain how they were misled about the fund or its risks in light of the “total mix of information” available to them. See, e.g., Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231–32 (1988) (“[T]o fulfill the materiality requirement ‘there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.’”). For example, a shareholder could not claim to have been misled by the word “green” in a fund’s name to believe the fund would never invest in oil or utility companies, if the fund’s prospectus explained how its investment process would be applied to such companies (without necessarily screening them out altogether) and the fund’s regular holdings reports clearly disclosed holdings in these types of companies. Likewise, an investor could not claim to have been misled by a “green bond” fund holding securities of carbon-emitting companies, so long as the bonds’ issuers and projects aligned with the stated investment objectives and process articulated in fund disclosures.Further, like all funds, ESG funds include in their disclosures detailed explanations of the risks that could prevent the fund from meeting its objectives—both financial results and ESG-related goals. Just as a fund’s financial results may be highly dependent on macroeconomic and portfolio-specific risk factors (e.g., inflation, interest rates, credit risk), so too various risk factors can affect a fund’s ability to construct a portfolio that meets its specified ESG objectives (e.g., technological advances, government policy on ESG disclosures, accuracy of company disclosures). The law is well-established that securities liability does not attach when a fund’s financial under-performance results from the manifestation of a fully-disclosed risk. See, e.g., Olkey v. Hyperion 1999 Term Tr., Inc., 98 F.3d 2, 9 (2d Cir. 1996) (“This court has consistently affirmed Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of securities claims where risks are disclosed in the prospectus”) (collecting cases). The same will hold true for alleged failures to meet stated ESG objectives resulting from risks that the funds fully disclosed.Moreover, plaintiff-shareholders in securities litigation would be required to allege and establish causation—that is, that a drop in the fund’s share price was caused by the alleged misstatement or omission in the fund’s disclosures. See, e.g., Dura Pharm. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 343 (2005) (noting that securities laws exist, “not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause”). Given that a fund’s share price is determined by the value of the securities in the portfolio, rather than by investor sentiment as with typical secondary market trading in operating companies, it can be difficult to establish such a causal link in any case between a fund’s disclosures and its share price. Doing so would likely be even more difficult where the disclosures in question relate to the incorporation of ESG considerations in the investment process, rather than typical financial risks.ConclusionFor the ESG investing movement to reach its full potential, there must be room in this highly-regulated marketplace for an array of investment options to meet the variety of ESG values and priorities held by investors. Just as different types of fixed income funds exist to satisfy investors’ varying appetites for financial risk and return (e.g., municipal, core, high-yield), so too a flourishing ESG fund sector will have room for various approaches to responsible investing to respond to investors’ varying value sets. Clear disclosure of each fund’s distinct investment approach remains the key to aligning fund objectives with the full panoply of investor values. Increasing industry use of standardized disclosures, as the SEC appears poised to require, will help investors more readily distinguish among types of ESG funds, and thus more effectively compare and contrast among true peer groups.

Agrees to Pay $34.37 Million to Settle Common Law and False Claims Act Allegations for Unsupported Diagnosis Codes,"Eargo Inc. (Eargo), a for-profit public corporation headquartered in California that sells and dispenses hearing aid devices directly to customers nationwide, has agreed to pay $34.37 million to resolve allegations that it submitted or caused the submission of claims for hearing aid devices for reimbursement to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) that contained unsupported hearing loss diagnosis codes.The FEHBP, administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is the largest employer-sponsored group health insurance program in the world. It provides health benefits through various health insurance carriers and covers over eight million federal employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses. Certain FEHBP health insurance plans elect to offer a hearing aid benefit, which varies from plan to plan. FEHBP carriers that offer a hearing aid benefit require that claims for hearing aid devices include a hearing loss-related diagnosis code. These diagnosis codes must be supported by a hearing loss diagnosis, which is typically based on a hearing test performed by a health care provider.“The FEHBP plays a vital role in ensuring the health and wellbeing of our nation’s dedicated civil servants and their families,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice is committed to the integrity of this program and will pursue appropriate remedies against providers who misuse it.”“Public servants rely on the FEHBP to keep their families healthy,” said U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas. “Billing the program for medical devices patients may not need raises costs across the board. We are proud to hold Eargo accountable for its alleged use of unsupported diagnosis codes.”“Submitting unsupported claims to the FEHBP, knowingly and otherwise, harms the American taxpayer,” said Deputy Inspector General Norbert E. Vint of OPM Office of the Inspector General (OPM-OIG). “I am incredibly grateful to our investigative staff and partners at the Department of Justice for their unwavering commitment to protecting the integrity of the FEHBP and preserving the trust fund for the health care of our nation’s dedicated civil servants.”The United States alleged that, from Jan. 1, 2017, through Jan. 31, 2021, Eargo included unsupported hearing loss-related diagnosis codes on claims for hearing aid devices that Eargo submitted to the FEHBP and on invoices — called superbills — that Eargo provided to FEHBP beneficiaries to obtain reimbursement for such devices from the FEHBP. The United States further alleged that between Feb. 1, 2021, and Sept. 22, 2021, Eargo continued to include these unsupported hearing loss-related diagnosis codes on claims and superbills — even after completing an internal review of its billing and coding practices in January 2021 — resulting in Eargo knowingly submitting or causing the submission of false claims for payment to the FEHBP.The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, with assistance from OPM-OIG.The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating health care fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement, can be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).The matter was handled by Fraud Section Trial Attorney Samuel Lehman and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth Coffin for the Northern District of Texas.The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability."

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK), a provider of EV charging services and equipment, saw its stock price rocket higher amid a recent avalanche of new deals and sales channel expansion. However, the initiation of a new securities fraud lawsuit against the company is now inducing a bloodbath in the stock.The matter came to a head yesterday as Culper Research published a damning report against Blink Charging, alleging that:“We believe that the Company has vastly exaggerated the size of its EV charging network in order to siphon money from the pockets of investors to insiders. Blink claims that “EV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging stations,” but we estimate the Company’s functional public charging station network consists of just 2,192 stations, a mere 15% of this claim.”The report goes on to note:""Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers. Our analysis of the Company’s own data suggests that the average charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per day (0.39% to 2.65% utilization), while annual charging revenue of a mere $6.37 per member suggests that the average Blink member doesn’t even obtain one single full charge from the Blink network over the course of an entire year. We think that even at 20x current utilization, Blink’s network would continue to incinerate cash. In sum, Blink vastly overstates the size, functionality, usage, and economic potential of its chargers.”While commenting on the implications of these “vastly exaggerated” claims, Culper believes that Blink Charging has committed securities fraud by building a Ponzi scheme, whereby, minority investors are exploited to benefit the insiders. As evidence, Culper asserts that Blink’s compensation expenses total $44 million since 2014. On the other hand, the company’s cumulative revenue amounts to only $18 million during this period. Moreover, Culper believes that the Chairman and CEO of Blink Charging, Michael D. Farkas, played a pivotal role in perpetrating this alleged fraud.These allegations have now become the focal point of a securities fraud investigation by Block & Leviton LLP, a national securities litigation firm. In a press statement, the firm has asked existing Blink Charging shareholders to contact its attorneys:“If you purchased or acquired shares of Blink Charging and have questions about your legal rights or possess information relevant to this matter, please contact Block & Leviton attorneys at (617) 398-5600, via email at cases@blockleviton.com , or at https://www.blockleviton.com/cases/blink.”Blink Charging shares are currently down over 15 percent, trading at $7.97 price level:SourceEver since peaking at $12.60 on the 5th of August, Blink Charging shares are down over 36 percent, based on the current stock price.Update: Another Negative Report Against Blink Charging Has AppearedIt appears another Blink Charging skeptic has appeared.

Litigation,https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/cannabis-crypto-crowdfunding-first-its-kind-litigation-finance-offering-2021-10-27/,"Cannabis, crypto and crowdfunding in first of its kind litigation finance offering","(Reuters) - An agricultural research and commercial hemp operation called Apothio LLC is officially the first plaintiff to attempt to fund a civil case by asking individual investors to buy crypto tokens in a crowdfunded “initial litigation offering.”That’s not any kind of official terminology, but it is the catchphrase you’ll find at the crowdfunding site Republic, which launched Apothio’s $5 million public offering on Tuesday. Apothio is hoping investors want a piece of its lawsuit accusing California officials of improperly destroying its $1 billion hemp crop in 2019.The ILO tag was devised by Apothio’s lawyers at Roche Freedman, who worked with Republic and the blockchain platform developer Ava Labs to structure and implement the offering after first announcing the concept last December.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterThe offering breaks new ground in several ways. It’s the first time that small investors can put up as little as $100 to acquire a stake in the outcome of civil litigation. (Individual investments are capped at $500,000.) The funder LexShares similarly allows individuals to invest in litigation finance deals, but those investors must meet the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s accreditation criteria.The Apothio offering, by contrast, is not limited to accredited investors because, in a milestone for litigation finance, the offering was registered under the SEC’s Regulation CF, which allows companies to raise as much as $5 million through crowdfunding without the formal rigamarole of a traditional securities offering.The Apothio offering also appears to be the first time that litigation funding has been “tokenized” through a blockchain. Apothio’s litigation investors will be issued Avalanche ILO tokens. If the company ends up winning the case and receiving a payout, investors will be paid their share via their Avalanche tokens.As of Wednesday afternoon, a day after the offering went live, 85 investors had agreed to put $156,500 into Apothio’s case. Thats more than 60% of the minimum target of $250,000 that Apothio set in its SEC registration of the offering.“I have never done this before and am interested how this all works,” one investor said in a comment posted at Republic. “Sounds like it could be a fun ride.”Apothio lawyer Kyle Roche of Roche Freedman said in an email statement that the new crowd-sourced litigation finance model will allow more plaintiffs to tap pools of capital.“The rise of litigation funding in the United States has provided individuals and smaller organizations access to the resources necessary to assert their legal rights against well-funded entities,” Roche’s statement said. “The advent of the ILO has the potential to provide even greater access to justice.”For an unbiased assessment of the crowdfunded litigation finance model, I reached out to Charles Agee, the CEO of litigation finance advisory firm Westfleet Advisors. Agee has a more holistic view of the commercial litigation finance industry than anyone else I know. He told me he’s generally in favor of innovation that democratizes and expands the market for litigation funding and is intrigued by Apothios concept.But he also said he has two big concerns about the offering.Agee’s first fear is that small investors don’t have enough litigation savvy and inside information to make informed investment decisions. In big commercial litigation finance deals, Agee said, funders often have access to non-public information that helps them decide if the case is a good bet. In Apothio’s offering, Republic is providing links to public filings from its case in federal court in Fresno, California, but no insider take on litigation risk.Agee said he’s also worried that crowdfunding may open the door to dubious suits. (He was speaking generally, not voicing a view of Apothio’s case.) Commercial litigation funders, Agee said, are effective gatekeepers precisely because they make sophisticated evaluations of litigation risk. After all, when commercial funders back a case, they usually put up a lot of money – an average $4.5 million for single-case deals, according to Westfleet’s analysis of 2020 transactions. Individual investors who are chipping in as little as $100 may not be as risk averse, Agee said.The Apothio deal does protect investors from the imminent risk that the case will be dismissed. Apothio sued Kern County, the Kern County sheriff’s office and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife after government officials ordered its 500-acre hemp harvest to be bulldozed in October 2019. The company, which conducts research on hemp and has research and internship agreements with two local community colleges, contends that the crop was legally grown and illegally destroyed. It is asserting violations of its rights under the U.S. and California constitutions.Both Kern County and the state have moved to dismiss Apothio’s case, arguing, in broad terms, that Apothio was growing an illegal marijuana crop for commercial distribution. (Hemp and marijuana are variations of the same cannabis species, cultivated to contain different levels of the psychoactive chemical THC.) Marijuana, the defendants argued, remains an illegal controlled substance under federal law and is only allowed to be grown for recreational use under state law. Apothio’s crop, they said, was contraband that does not give rise to property or constitutional claims.The underlying law and facts, including the nature of Apothio’s relationships with the community colleges and interpretations of the federal law exempting hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, are complex, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Thurston seems to be in no hurry to rule on the defendants’ dismissal motions. They’ve been fully briefed since the summer of 2020 but the next hearing in the case isn’t scheduled to take place until next January.If the case is dismissed, Apothio investors will lose only 20% of their investment, under Apothio’s investment contract. Until Thurston issues a decision on the defendants’ motions to dismiss, Roche Freedman will hold 80% of investors funds in an escrow account. If Apothio loses, the law firm will return investors money. If Apothio loses at a later stage, investors are out of luck.The Apothio experiment may turn out to be short-lived. But even if so, I don’t think this will be the last use of the crowdfunding model in litigation finance.Opinions expressed here are those of the author.

Litigation,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/oil-industry-faces-litigation-worth-billions-in-louisiana-courts,,"Louisiana local governments scored what they called an “extraordinary victory” this week as federal judges allowed them to use the state court system to seek billions of dollars from oil and gas companies for the state’s receding coastline.The Aug. 10 ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit gives Louisiana parishes their preferred forum to pursue claims that Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron USA Inc. , and other companies, both large and small, destroyed coastal marshes and wetlands by failing to follow state permits regulating well drilling, canal construction, waste disposal, and landscape restoration.The litigation has enormously high stakes for the industry, as Louisiana parishes pursue 42 lawsuits aimed at making more than 200 companies cough up billions of dollars for the damage. The Fifth Circuit’s decision focuses on two cases from Plaquemines and Cameron parishes, but has implications for the dozens of others that have been caught in legal limbo for years.While the ruling itself is narrow, it clears a path for the parishes’ lawsuits to move toward discovery and trial. State courts are generally seen as a more favorable venue for local governments.“Once things start to get rolling in discovery and information starts coming out, it’s going to be harder and harder for the industry to try to make this just disappear,” said Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans.The coastal cases will now move back to state court where—barring any successful rehearing petition or U.S. Supreme Court bid by industry lawyers—plaintiffs will push for a prompt trial date, said Talbot, Carmouche & Marcello APLC attorney John Carmouche, who represents the parishes.‘Protect Our Coast’The ruling is “an extraordinary victory for the people of Louisiana,” Carmouche said. He added in a statement that the ruling paves the way to “protect our coast and its resources for future generations.”But industry advocates stressed the decision was merely procedural and focused on a narrow timing issue: that the defendants were too late in raising certain arguments for moving the cases to federal court.“Whether these cases move forward in federal court or state court, we will continue to defend against the meritless cases and show why the lawsuits do nothing for Louisiana’s coast,” leaders of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association and Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association said in a joint statement. The trade groups’ membership includes defendants in the cases.According to the Grow Louisiana Coalition, another industry group, the state’s oil and gas companies have funded more than $230 million in coastal building and protection projects.The oil companies are exploring their legal options, Melissa Landry, spokeswoman for the legal teams representing BP America Production Company, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Pipeline Co., and Shell, said in a phone interview Thursday.Coastal Land LossThe litigation centers on the fate of Louisiana’s critical coastline. Nearly 2 million people live and work in the coastal wetlands that act as a buffer against hurricane storm surge, according to Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, a state agency. Ports in the region also supply 18% of the nation’s oil supply, according to the agency.But nearly 1,900 square miles of land has been lost since the 1930s, and the state stands to lose another 4,120 square miles over the next 50 years, the agency said. The erosion threatens homes and businesses, as well as infrastructure, including flood protection systems.Human-made factors contribute to land loss, amid natural threats posed by rising sea levels, subsidence, storms, and invasive species. Levees and floodgates on the Mississippi River deprive the coastal ecosystem of needed fresh water and sediment, while dredging canals for oil and gas exploration and pipelines has disrupted marshes.The 42 lawsuits from coastal parishes say they want the oil and gas industry to pay for its role in the slow-moving disaster. Their claims differ from other cases against oil companies from state and local governments in Maryland, Colorado, California, and elsewhere, which focus on holding the industry financially responsible for the local impacts of climate change, primarily driven by use of fossil fuels.The parishes are hoping to build on the success of private landowners who prevailed when they sued oil and gas companies for damages for not meeting lease provisions requiring them to restore property after drilling. The Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the precedent in 2003, putting the obligation of the restoration costs on the oil companies.Carmouche announced a $100 million settlement in September 2019 with Freeport McMoRan Inc., but the deal remains tenuous. This spring, state lawmakers killed a bill that would have established a framework for spending the money. The presidents of two parishes that must approve the deal have also testified that flood control measures along the Mississippi River are to blame for coastal damage.Legal Ping-PongThe mass of lawsuits from the six Louisiana parishes involved has had industry on edge for years as individual cases bounced through state and federal courts. So far, the two sides have been stuck in a legal tug-of-war over where the litigation belongs.Backed by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and the state attorney general, parish leaders filed their first claims in state court seven years ago. Industry lawyers unsuccessfully pushed to transfer them to the federal level, arguing that the litigation involved federal questions.But the industry defendants tried again in 2018, linking their arguments to a new expert report that said the parishes’ claims were based in part on oil and gas drillers’ actions taken during World War II. The drillers were acting under the direction of federal government officials during the war, so legal claims related to those actions belong in federal court, they argued.The Fifth Circuit rejected the latest argument as untimely, concluding that the 2018 report simply repeated information the parishes included in earlier legal filings.The ruling, if it withstands potential challenges, means the cases will move ahead in Louisiana state courts, which Tulane Law School professor Oliver A. Houck said is important.“Experiences show the venue in these cases is, when it’s federal, can be very hostile” to the plaintiffs, he said. Federal judges and juries tend to be more “removed from the action,” he said, and less likely to understand the on-the-ground impacts of coastal land loss.“That’s exactly what the industry wants,” Houck said. “At least in state court, you’ve got a fighting chance.”"

Lyft disclosed in a securities filing late Wednesday that Llewellyn has replaced its longtime general counsel Kristin Sverchek, who has moved into the position of president of business affairs.Lyft said in a statement provided to Bloomberg Law that Llewellyn, who previously led its litigation team, has “guided the company through the numerous legal challenges associated with its growth from a small, private San Francisco-only company to a public company with a presence in all fifty states and Canada.”Sverchek’s new role as Lyft’s first-ever president of business affairs will see her duties expand, the company said. Sverchek will unify Lyft’s general and administrative functions and “focus on company-wide initiatives and increasing the operational effectiveness of the business,” Lyft said.The coronavirus pandemic and a drop in demand led Lyft to furlough thousands of employees and reduce executive salaries. Lyft and Uber both face mounting litigation—and a complicated regulatory landscape—over their decision to classify drivers as independent contractors, rather than full-time employees.Lyft has turned to law firms Keker, Van Nest & Peters, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Barnes & Thornburg, among others, to help fend off those challenges.Sverchek joined Lyft as its first top lawyer in 2012. She currently owns nearly $19.3 million in Lyft stock, according to Bloomberg data.Lyft’s most recent proxy statement shows that Sverchek received nearly $3.6 million in total compensation during fiscal 2020, down from the nearly $6 million in total pay she earned from the San Francisco-based company in 2019.Securities filings show that Sverchek has sold off nearly $3.3 million in Lyft stock this year. She has been given additional restricted stock units in the company in her new role as president of business affairs, according to Lyft.In September, Sverchek and Lyft made headlines for teaming up with archrival Uber to take a stand against a restrictive new anti-abortion law in Texas.Sverchek began her career as an associate at startup-focused law firm Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian. She helped take Lyft public in 2019. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati advised Lyft on its initial public offering.Llewellyn, Lyft’s new legal chief, joined the company as a managing counsel for litigation in 2014. Prior to that role, which saw Llewellyn serve as Lyft’s first in-house litigator, she was an associate at Winston & Strawn in San Francisco.“As one of the company’s most tenured attorneys, Lindsay has a long track record of advising Lyft on a wide variety of cutting edge and high-profile legal matters, while navigating the intersection of the company’s legal, policy and brand objectives,” Lyft said in a statement.The company credited Llewellyn for building a team of litigators covering areas like consumer class actions, competition, insurance coverage disputes, intellectual property and regulatory matters. Llewellyn also served as its interim general counsel from January to May of this year, Lyft said."
Litigation,https://www.npr.org/2022/02/25/1082901958/opioid-settlement-johnson-26-billion,4 U.S. companies will pay $26 billion to settle claims they fueled the opioid crisis,"4 U.S. companies will pay $26 billion to settle claims they fueled the opioid crisisEnlarge this image toggle caption Keith Srakocic/AP file photo Keith Srakocic/AP file photoFour of the largest U.S. corporations have agreed to pay roughly $26 billion to settle a tsunami of lawsuits linked to claims that their business practices helped fuel the deadly opioid crisis.Johnson & Johnson, the consumer products and health giant that manufactured generic opioid medications, will contribute $5 billion to the settlement.The company announced in 2020 it would get out of the prescription opioid business in the U.S. altogether.Three massive drug wholesalers — AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — will pay a combined $21 billion.""This settlement represents real accountability,"" said North Carolina state Attorney General Josh Stein, who helped negotiate the deal.Stein noted that most of the funds are earmarked for health care and drug treatment programs designed to ease the opioid crisis.""There will be people alive next year because of the programs and services we will be able to fund because of these settlement proceeds,"" he said.None of the companies acknowledged any wrongdoing for their role manufacturing and distributing large quantities of pain medications at a time when opioid addiction and overdoses were surging.In a joint statement, the drug wholesalers said they had determined that enough governments had signed onto the deal to move forward with a ""comprehensive agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits.""In all, 46 states and roughly 90% of eligible local governments have signed on to the deal, according to the companies assessment.In a separate statement, Johnson & Johnson said its contribution to the deal would ""directly support state and local efforts to make meaningful progress in addressing the opioid crisis.""The deal settles thousands of lawsuitsThis settlement resolves thousands of civil lawsuits filed against the companies beginning in 2014 by local and state governments as well as Native American tribes nationwide.""The settlement will provide thousands of communities across the United States with up to approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years,"" the drug distributors said in their statement.AmerisourceBergen will pay $6.1 billion, Cardinal Health will pay $6 billion and McKesson, $7.4 billion.Broad outlines of the deal were first unveiled in July 2021 but the companies said they wouldnt accept the settlement unless enough governments agreed to sign on and drop their suits.Initial payments will begin in April and will continue over the next two decades.A dangerous moment in the opioid crisisThe money will arrive at a moment when the opioid epidemic has escalated dangerously.Many Americans with opioid use disorder have shifted from taking prescription pain pills to street fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is far more powerful and lethal.Drug overdoses now kill more than 100,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Joe Rice, with the firm Motley Rice, is one of the lead attorneys suing the drug industry over its alleged role in the opioid crisis.He supports this settlement and said the funds will help devastated communities ""start rebuilding ... and deal with this epidemic.""Rice said the deal was structured in collaboration with local government officials to avoid a problem that arose with the $246 billion tobacco settlement of the 1990s.Much of that money has been siphoned off for projects unrelated to the public health impacts of tobacco addiction.Rice said he believes that wont happen this time. ""Going into the opioid litigation, that was recognized as being a big problem that we had to fix,"" he said.According to Stein, companies have also agreed to fund a new monitoring system to prevent communities from again being flooded with high-risk medications.""If there are too many pills going into a community, an alarm will go off, a red flag will be issued, and distributors will be put on notice,"" Stein said.""It will ensure that no more communities are awash in opioids as happened over the last couple of decades.""Lawsuits highlighted the actions of companies during the crisisWhile companies acknowledge no wrongdoing in this deal, opioid lawsuits laid bare company practices that state attorneys general say were deeply troubling.In some cases, drug wholesalers continued shipping vast quantities of pills to small rural communities despite red flags that drugs like OxyContin were being diverted and sold on the black market.One email shared among executives at AmerisourceBergen — made public for the first time during a state trial last year in West Virginia — disparaged people addicted to opioids, describing them as ""pillbillies"" and referring to OxyContin as ""hillbilly heroin.""With this $26 billion settlement now approved, negotiations continue over a separate opioid deal involving Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, and members of the Sackler family who own the private company.That deal, if finalized, is expected to include payouts topping $6 billion.Meanwhile, opioid-related lawsuits continue in state and federal courts around the country focused largely on pharmacy chains that sold large quantities of opioid medications directly to consumers."
Litigation,https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-climate-disclosure-proposal-looms-as-litigation-risk-11648299600,SEC Climate Disclosure Proposal Looms as Litigation Risk,"A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal that would mandate strict climate reporting from public companies could dramatically increase the exposure of these businesses to costly securities litigation.Lawyers that represent corporations and investors said that the proposal, released earlier this week, could be a potent source of securities fraud litigation, which targets companies over alleged lies or even half-truths told to the investing public.The underlying premise is simple: Make a company talk more—on the record, in their mandatory disclosures like annual reports—and you are more likely to catch it in a mistake that could prove lucrative for the aggressive plaintiffs’ lawyers that earn a living suing companies after bad news.“The plaintiffs lawyers are waiting in the wings,” said Craig Marcus, a partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP who advises prominent public companies. “Get some disclosures, settlement and collect a fee? Yeah, absolutely.”The SEC on Monday released its more than 500-page proposal for a set of climate disclosure requirements that would, if adopted, be among the most expansive and complex disclosure requirements the agency has yet put forward.Newsletter Sign-up WSJ | Risk and Compliance Journal Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. PREVIEWThe rule is meant to bring order to what has been uneven climate reporting by different public companies. In place of voluntary sustainability reports which use handpicked metrics, companies would have to disclose in much greater detail how much carbon they emit and how they plan to address looming climate risks. In theory, investors could then make more informed comparisons of businesses.Observers already have noted that the new regime would require companies to expend considerable resources to craft these disclosures. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a Republican who has been a critic of proposals to expand the SEC’s purview, said on Monday that the rule could create a “climate industrial complex” of newly enriched consultants.That cost would be evident quickly, but private securities litigation tied to new climate disclosures represents a lurking threat that could materialize down the road.Plaintiffs’ lawyers in typical cases pair with investors to sue a company over stock drops linked to issues a company didn’t adequately flag. A company might be sued, for example, if it says it has a substantial antibribery program but ends up caught in a corruption scandal.The wide-ranging climate disclosures the SEC wants would up the number of avenues for a lawsuit. A wildfire in California destroys a facility, for example, and investors could claim they were misled about the company’s climate risk management. Or arguably investors could sue if the company miscalculated greenhouse-gas emissions.For some companies, the SEC’s proposed rule would mandate that they determine and disclose emissions caused by supply networks and their customers in connection with their products, tricky endeavors that require assembling data many companies haven’t previously considered.“What you disclose exactly and how you measure it is developing in real time,” said Amanda Halter, managing partner of the Houston office at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. “We’re kind of building the plane as we’re flying it.”The requirements could end up fueling a “dispute machine,” Ms. Halter said. Companies outside of the sectors traditionally heavily regulated under environmental rules will have to begin thinking proactively about their broad environmental impacts, she added.The proposed rule wouldn’t impact companies immediately. It has a long lead time, with some companies not required to comply until 2026, and it is almost certain to face a legal campaign to squash it. Commissioner Peirce argued on Monday that the rule is outside the SEC’s authority to propose, and many lawyers agree that even if the SEC prevailed in any legal challenge to the rule, it will certainly face a tough fight.Some plaintiffs’ lawyers are cautiously optimistic.“What the SEC is doing is encouraging much more accurate and complete disclosures, and you may see litigation if there are material omissions or misstatements made to investors with regard to those climate disclosures,” said Darren Robbins, whose law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP brought securities actions that last year resulted in about $1.9 billion in settlements.Mr. Robbins, though, added that “it’s still early.”“We’ll see what the final rule says and how companies comply with it,” he said.Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com"
Litigation,https://www.opb.org/article/2022/03/02/court-approves-225-million-settlement-in-precision-castparts-air-pollution-lawsuit/,Court approves $22.5 million settlement in Precision Castparts air pollution lawsuit,"Precision Castparts Corp. has agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit over air pollution coming from its metal parts manufacturing facility in Southeast Portland.Last week, a Multnomah County Circuit Court judge gave preliminary approval to the settlement, which stems from allegations that the metal casting facility emitted toxic metals and polluted nearby homes.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a SponsorThe settlement includes $7.7 million the company already spent on air pollution controls to reduce the amount of nickel and other pollutants being released from Precision Castparts’ operations.The company has also spent more than $300,000 on air monitoring equipment to test for pollution in the surrounding neighborhood and will be required to install nearly $2 million in additional pollution controls at its facilities pending an additional court approval.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a SponsorMatthew Preusch, an attorney representing some of the company’s neighbors in the class action lawsuit, said it’s the largest environmental class action settlement in Oregon history.“It’s going to result in meaningful air quality improvements for all the people in Southeast Portland,” Preusch said. “We are proud that after years of hard-fought litigation we have been able to reach a very excellent outcome.”Preusch also represented plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit against Bullseye Glass, a glass manufacturer that was connected to toxic metal air pollution. Bullseye Glass settled that case for $6.5 million. Both cases emerged out of a 2016 U.S. Forest Service study of moss that revealed previously unknown levels of toxic metals in Southeast Portland’s air.Based on the outcome of that case, Preusch estimates residents affected by Precision Castparts pollution will receive about $3,500 apiece. A $12.5 million settlement fund will pay for attorneys, and the remainder of the money will be divided among residents who lived in the area affected by pollution from the facility. The amount that each person receives will depend on how many people file claims. Claims or challenges to the settlement must be filed by April 9.Information is being distributed this week to about 6,000 Southeast Portland households that are eligible to file a claim for damages in the case. Residents can find information about eligibility on the website www.structuralssettlement.com, which also includes court documents and maps of the residential area affected by the case.In a statement, Precision Castparts said the settlement will allow the company “to resolve costly, long-term litigation.” The company manufactures metal parts for airplanes and other industrial products.“As always, we will remain in compliance with our air regulatory permits and will continue to invest in strong emission control technology as part of our commitment to the environment and our community,” the company said."
Litigation,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/proposed-alternative-ptab-discretionary-denial-factors-view-co-pending-parallel,Proposed Alternative PTAB Discretionary Denial Factors In View of Co-Pending Parallel Litigation,"Friday, October 2, 2020The authors propose replacing the PTAB’s current NHK-Fintiv factors with the alternative “Babcock-Train Factors” set forth herein.1 These alternative factors have been crafted in an effort to provide clearer institution guidance to the PTAB’s Administrative Patent Judges (“APJs”), and to afford a neutral perspective with respect to both the particular posture of the party in the PTAB proceeding (petitioner or patent owner) and the specific venue of the parallel district court litigation.To be clear, the authors do not suggest that these alternative factors should be the definitive guidelines promulgated by the USPTO. Rather, they are proposed to initiate a dialog among PTAB stakeholders. Refinements, revisions, and improvements to this proposal are both likely and welcome, especially given the collective experience and varied perspectives of the diverse PTAB community. But the authors hope that this proposal will provide a basis for a productive continuing dialog on an important and increasingly controversial issue.The Need for Clarity and Fairness in the PTAB’s Discretionary Denial AnalysisThere can be little legitimate dispute that Congress provided the Director with discretion to deny institution of an IPR/PGR/CBM proceeding. 35 U.S.C. § 314(a). But Congress was largely silent regarding the precise manner in which the Director should exercise that discretion, as well as the particular rules that should be promulgated for doing so. Certainly, the Administrative Procedures Act provides constraints on the Director’s discretion, but (of course) those limitations are not specific to the PTAB’s institution decision.Over the course of its post-AIA existence, the PTAB has established jurisprudence for exercising its discretion to deny petitions procedurally, including promulgating the seven General Plastic factors2 for evaluating so-called “follow-on” petitions (under Section 314(a)), and the six Becton Dickinson factors3 for evaluating arguments and evidence previously considered by the USPTO (under 35 U.S.C. § 325(d)).4 More recently, the PTAB has adopted the NHK-Fintiv factors to support discretionary denial of IPR petitions based on parallel district court litigation, which has generated considerable discussion within the PTAB bar and beyond.5The authors have recently conducted a statistical analysis of the Board’s invocation and application of the NHK-Fintiv factors to provide some insights into how the PTAB evaluates and weighs each of the six NHK-Fintiv factors from a macro perspective, irrespective of the specific and unique facts of each case.6 That study, together with the further analysis discussed herein, indicates that the current set of NHK-Fintiv factors is not venue-neutral, significantly disfavoring petitioners who are defendants in so-called “fast track” district courts, such as the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas.7 In particular, expanding that previous statistical analysis to consider the specific venue of the parallel district court litigation reveals that cases pending in those two Texas venues are far more likely to receive a discretionary denial of institution from the PTAB’s application of the NHK-Fintiv factors than are cases pending in all other venues. The supplemental statistical chart shown below in Table 1 reveals this stark contrast, where cases pending in the two Texas venues are more likely than not to have PTAB petitions discretionarily denied, as opposed to cases pending in all other venues that are exceedingly unlikely to have PTAB petitions denied:8Table 1Moreover, the NHK-Fintiv factors have proven to be vague in some respects and overlapping in focus, and the manner of briefing and analyzing these factors (particularly by PTAB practitioners) has often been conflicting and/or imprecise.9 From the authors’ perspectives, the sudden importance of the NHK-Fintiv factors has engendered time consuming and expensive ancillary disputes—frequently in the form of reply and sur-reply briefs—with the parties often disagreeing not only on the relevant facts that should be considered, but also on the proper manner in which to conduct of the NHK-Fintiv analysis.The Growing Clamor for the PTAB to Revisit its Discretionary Denial AnalysisThe PTAB elevated the NHK-Fintiv factors to “precedential” status on May 5, 202010 (having elevated the NHK decision to that status about a year earlier),11 and the impact of that decision has since reverberated loudly within the PTAB bar and beyond.12 Intriguingly, the NHK-Fintiv analysis has even elicited respectful dissent from within the APJ bench, which is rare for the PTAB. In one notable example, an experienced and distinguished APJ13 dissented from the majority’s denial of institution in view of parallel litigation in the Eastern District of Texas, concluding his detailed analyses with the following lucid observations:I also take note of Fintiv’s statement that our evaluation of the factors should be based on “a holistic view of whether efficiency and integrity of the system are best served by denying or instituting review.” Fintiv at 6. And in this sense, a weighing of individual factors aside, I cannot agree with the majority that denying institution here best serves the efficiency and integrity of the patent system. The Petitioner here did exactly what Congress envisioned in providing for inter partes reviews in the America Invents Act: upon being sued for infringement, and having received notice of the claims it was alleged to infringe, it diligently filed a Petition with the Board, seeking review of the patentability of those claims in the alternative tribunal created by the AIA. . . . The inter partes review would proceed, necessarily having a narrower scope than the infringement trial before the district court, and would resolve in an efficient manner the patentability questions so that the district court need not take them up. I fail to see how this outcome would be inconsistent with the “efficiency and integrity of the system.”14While some parties have challenged the NHK-Fintiv analysis in its entirety,15 other stakeholders have acknowledged the PTAB’s statutory authority to exercise its discretion, but have nonetheless criticized the Board’s rulemaking process:The Original Plaintiffs also ask this Court to set aside the current way the Director exercises such discretion because it did not arise through notice-and-comment rulemaking. This implicates the Small Business Inventors’ need for clear regulations promulgated lawfully by the Director that preserves and improves (not eliminates) the Director’s full powers of discretionary denial.16 ― The PTAB is increasingly refusing to institute otherwise-meritorious IPR petitions for purely procedural reasons. And it is doing so through self-declared precedential decisions that promulgate new PTAB policies without notice-and-comment rulemaking or the possibility of judicial review. . . . Congress could also encourage the PTAB to engage in traditional rulemaking when setting new policy for how and when to exercise its discretion, as the Federal Circuit and commenters have also indicated they should.17― Precedential decisions NHK and Fintiv have not translated to predictability. Both decisions provide “non-exclusive” factors that are to be “weighed” as a part of a “balanced assessment”. What does this mean? No one knows. How is a factor to be scored and how much weight does each get and what score will assure or prevent denial of institution? A sample of recent institution decisions illustrates the problem.... There are many other apparently conflicting decisions which are altogether undecipherable. The analysis under NHK and Fintiv has only added complexity and unpredictability to the institution decision. Clear and unambiguous rules would alleviate this and achieve the intended purpose of §314(a) and §316(b).18While the authors purposely do not weigh in on any pending litigation, PTAB proceeding, USPTO petition, or Congressional activity, they believe that it is likely that the USPTO will—at some point in the future, whether through formal rulemaking or otherwise—re-address the factors that the PTAB should consider in deciding whether to discretionarily deny institution of an IPR or PGR petition in view of co-pending parallel litigation.The Proposed “Babcock-Train” Discretionary Denial Factors In View of Co-Pending Parallel LitigationIn light of the foregoing discussion, the authors propose that the PTAB de-designate the NHK-Fintiv factors as precedential authority,19 and in their place adopt (via formal rulemaking or otherwise) an alternative set of non-exhaustive discretionary denial factors as follows (in decreasing order of weight):1) Alacrity of the Petitioner – The timing between service of the complaint in the parallel district court or ITC litigation, and the filing of the PTAB petition.Guidance: The longer the petitioner’s delay beyond four (4) months of service of the complaint, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this factor should be nearly dispositive in favor of institution for timely filed PGRs.Commentary: The petitioner should be afforded a reasonable opportunity after service of the complaint to evaluate the asserted patent and, inter alia, collect and review the prior art, consult with an expert witness, and prepare the petition and supporting declaration. The authors suggest that four (4) months (⅓ of the statutory 1-year time bar for IPRs under 35 U.S.C. § 315(b)) is a reasonable and expeditious time frame for filing a PTAB petition.A PGR petition must be filed within nine months of a first-to-file patent’s issue date. 35 U.S.C. § 321(c). The AIA legislative history emphasizes the importance of having the PTAB review PGRs early in the life of the challenged patent, before expensive district court litigation ensues.20 Accordingly, the PTAB should have a very strong (and likely absolute) interest in reviewing a timely filed PGR petition.2) Merits of the Petition – The strength of the collective patentability challenge. Guidance: The weaker the merits of the collective patentability challenge, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. The term “collective patentability challenge” is used consistently with the PTAB’s institution analysis under the SAS Institute decision21 (i.e., at least one ground and one claim).Commentary: The USPTO should have a strong interest in reevaluating an issued patent when the petition convincingly demonstrates that the challenged patent is, at least in part, defective. Elevating the merits-based consideration (from the catch-all Factor 6 in the NHK-Fintiv analysis) is essential in order for the USPTO to play its important patentability gatekeeper role as mandated by Congress in the AIA.3) Litigation History of the Challenged Patent – The frequency of assertion of the challenged patent, including assertion in the U.S. district courts and the ITC. Guidance: The more frequently the challenged patent has been asserted beyond one time, the more this factor weighs against discretionary denial, and vice versa.Commentary: The USPTO should have a strong interest in reevaluating an issued patent when it has been asserted frequently, including formally (e.g., in the U.S. district courts and the ITC) and informally (e.g., cease and desist letters, which indicate a likelihood of future formal assertion). The potential for divergent district court and ITC claim construction and invalidity determinations highlights the USPTO’s role of providing a uniform patentability analysis. Further, the TC Heartland decision,22 which has resulted in the distribution of patent infringement cases in a significantly greater number of venues, increases the likelihood of divergent district court decisions regarding an asserted patent.This factor assumes that the challenged patent has been asserted once, namely, in the co-pending parallel litigation. In addition, the inclusion of informal assertions in this factor is not intended to affect the PTAB’s limited discovery practices and public disclosure requirements. Rather, consideration of informal assertions should be permitted to indicate the potential for future litigation.4) Longevity of the Challenged Patent – The remaining time until the challenged patent’s expiration. Guidance: The shorter the challenged patent’s remaining life, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa.Commentary: A patent with a longer life poses a larger potential for future disputes, and thus the PTAB should have a greater interest in evaluating a patentability challenge to a patent with a longer remaining term. The policy considerations for Babcock-Train Factor 3, as discussed above, also apply to this factor.5) Section 315 Estoppel Effects – The extent to which the accused defendants in the litigation will be estopped under 35 U.S.C. § 315(e)(2) with respect to the PTAB challenges as applied to the petitioner, its privies, and the RPIs in the PTAB proceeding. Guidance: The lesser the extent of the estoppel on the relevant parties, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. The Panel should disregard additionally named and/or omitted parties in the parallel district court or ITC litigation who do not materially affect the substance of the principal infringement and invalidity allegations. Also, the Panel should disregard any district court or ITC invalidity allegations that would not have been permitted in the PTAB challenge.Commentary: Certainly Congress’ intent in establishing IPR and PGR reviews was to provide an alternative forum for evaluating certain patent validity (patentability) challenges, and generally to allow the petitioner with a single bite at that proverbial apple. To the extent that the PTAB proceeding will not effectively accomplish that “single bite” purpose, then the USPTO should have less interest in instituting trial. Note, however, that parties should not be able to “game” this factor by naming and/or deleting parties in the parallel district court or ITC litigation who do not substantively affect the principal infringement and invalidity allegations. And permissible district court or ITC validity assertions that would not be permitted in the PTAB challenge (e.g., a Section 101 challenge in an IPR) should not be considered in this factor.6) Stage of the District Court or ITC Proceeding(s) – The prospective stage of the parallel district court or ITC litigation beyond Markman as of the scheduled date for the PTAB’s DI. Guidance: The further the parallel district court or ITC litigation will have likely progressed beyond the Markman proceedings at the expected date of the DI, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. If the district court or ITC has granted a stay, this factor will weigh against discretionary denial, but not vice versa.Commentary: In conjunction with Factor 1, this factor assumes that most parallel district or ITC cases will have been proceeding for about 10 months at the expected date for the PTAB’s Decision on Institution (“DI”), and thus have begun (and possibly completed) the Markman stage of the litigation. This factor also (realistically) assumes that most district courts will not grant a pre-institution stay given the steadily declining IPR/PGR institution rate (currently ∼55%),23 and that the ITC will rarely grant such a stay. But in consideration of efficiency and notice to the district court or ITC, defendants should be encouraged to seek a stay if they so desire, and they should not be penalized by the PTAB for doing so. This factor also neutralizes the impact of the district court’s or ITC’s Markman proceeding because the parties’ briefing, and the district court’s or ITC’s analysis, regarding claim construction under the common Phillips standard can be readily considered by the PTAB. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b).A summary of the Babcock-Train Factors is provided in Table 2 below.The Proposed “Babcock-Train” Factors Effectively Incorporate the Salient Considerations of the Current NHK-Fintiv FactorsThe alternative “Babcock-Train” factors set forth above are not oblivious to the considerations that prompted the PTAB to adopt the NHK-Fintiv analysis. Indeed, most of the salient considerations of the NHK-Fintiv factors have been incorporated into the proposed alternative factors.NHK-Fintiv Factor 1 (“whether the court granted a stay or evidence exists that one may be granted if a proceeding is instituted”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor 6.NHK-Fintiv Factor 2 (“proximity of the court’s trial date to the Board’s projected statutory deadline for a final written decision”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor No. 6. At the pre-institution stage, attempting to predict the timing of a district court’s future trial date is very speculative, often little more than an educated and partially informed guess about events more than a year in the future. District courts routinely schedule multiple cases for trial in the same time frame, reasonably expecting that many of those cases will settle at some point before trial (like airlines who routinely overbook flights based on statistical cancellation rates). Accordingly, trial dates are frequently postponed, either by the Court sua sponte or in conjunction with party stipulation.24 The PTAB should not engage in such error-prone speculation, and should not make an important institution decision based on information that is speculative and very likely to become inaccurate after the PTAB issues its DI.The authors appreciate that proposed Babcock-Train Factor 6 (“stage of the district court proceeding”) would also require some speculation by the Board. But by shifting the focus from the distant trial date to the initial Markman proceedings, at the time of the POPR, the proposed forward-looking perspective is only 3 months (not 15 months), which is more likely to be ascertainable. Further, the parties are able to update the Board pre-institution through the submission of Supplemental Information (see 37 C.F.R. § 42.123(c)) or potentially other less formal means. In any event, the authors have included this factor last in the list, partly because of this implicit uncertainty.NHK-Fintiv Factor 3 (“investment in the parallel proceeding by the court and the parties”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been incorporated into Babcock-Train Factors 1 and 6. By filing an expeditious petition (pre-Markman), the investment in the parallel proceeding should be significantly reduced compared to filing a petition on the one-year deadline, which has likely allowed the parallel proceeding to advance beyond Markman.NHK-Fintiv Factor 4 (“overlap between issues raised in the petition and in the parallel proceeding”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor No. 5. In district court litigation, an accused infringer will nearly always assert one or more counterclaims for patent invalidity. If the accused infringer has filed a PTAB petition, those counterclaims will usually (not surprisingly) encompass the same challenges as set forth in the petition. Congress imposed estoppel on a petitioner and its privies only after the PTAB issues a Final Written Decision (“FWD”) (37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b)), so penalizing the petitioner earlier unfairly attempts to broaden the statutory estoppel. Pre-FWD, the petitioner should not be penalized for preserving its rights by raising those same arguments in the parallel district court or ITC litigation, and should not be effectively compelled to make some formal waiver of its litigation invalidity challenges by the PTAB.25NHK-Fintiv Factor 5 (“whether the petitioner and the defendant in the parallel proceeding are the same party”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor 5.NHK-Fintiv Factor 6 (“other circumstances that impact the Board’s exercise of discretion, including the merits”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been incorporated into Babcock-Train Factors 1-4.

Litigation,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/proposed-alternative-ptab-discretionary-denial-factors-view-co-pending-parallel,Proposed Alternative PTAB Discretionary Denial Factors In View of Co-Pending Parallel Litigation,"Friday, October 2, 2020The authors propose replacing the PTAB’s current NHK-Fintiv factors with the alternative “Babcock-Train Factors” set forth herein.1 These alternative factors have been crafted in an effort to provide clearer institution guidance to the PTAB’s Administrative Patent Judges (“APJs”), and to afford a neutral perspective with respect to both the particular posture of the party in the PTAB proceeding (petitioner or patent owner) and the specific venue of the parallel district court litigation.To be clear, the authors do not suggest that these alternative factors should be the definitive guidelines promulgated by the USPTO. Rather, they are proposed to initiate a dialog among PTAB stakeholders. Refinements, revisions, and improvements to this proposal are both likely and welcome, especially given the collective experience and varied perspectives of the diverse PTAB community. But the authors hope that this proposal will provide a basis for a productive continuing dialog on an important and increasingly controversial issue.The Need for Clarity and Fairness in the PTAB’s Discretionary Denial AnalysisThere can be little legitimate dispute that Congress provided the Director with discretion to deny institution of an IPR/PGR/CBM proceeding. 35 U.S.C. § 314(a). But Congress was largely silent regarding the precise manner in which the Director should exercise that discretion, as well as the particular rules that should be promulgated for doing so. Certainly, the Administrative Procedures Act provides constraints on the Director’s discretion, but (of course) those limitations are not specific to the PTAB’s institution decision.Over the course of its post-AIA existence, the PTAB has established jurisprudence for exercising its discretion to deny petitions procedurally, including promulgating the seven General Plastic factors2 for evaluating so-called “follow-on” petitions (under Section 314(a)), and the six Becton Dickinson factors3 for evaluating arguments and evidence previously considered by the USPTO (under 35 U.S.C. § 325(d)).4 More recently, the PTAB has adopted the NHK-Fintiv factors to support discretionary denial of IPR petitions based on parallel district court litigation, which has generated considerable discussion within the PTAB bar and beyond.5The authors have recently conducted a statistical analysis of the Board’s invocation and application of the NHK-Fintiv factors to provide some insights into how the PTAB evaluates and weighs each of the six NHK-Fintiv factors from a macro perspective, irrespective of the specific and unique facts of each case.6 That study, together with the further analysis discussed herein, indicates that the current set of NHK-Fintiv factors is not venue-neutral, significantly disfavoring petitioners who are defendants in so-called “fast track” district courts, such as the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas.7 In particular, expanding that previous statistical analysis to consider the specific venue of the parallel district court litigation reveals that cases pending in those two Texas venues are far more likely to receive a discretionary denial of institution from the PTAB’s application of the NHK-Fintiv factors than are cases pending in all other venues. The supplemental statistical chart shown below in Table 1 reveals this stark contrast, where cases pending in the two Texas venues are more likely than not to have PTAB petitions discretionarily denied, as opposed to cases pending in all other venues that are exceedingly unlikely to have PTAB petitions denied:8Table 1Moreover, the NHK-Fintiv factors have proven to be vague in some respects and overlapping in focus, and the manner of briefing and analyzing these factors (particularly by PTAB practitioners) has often been conflicting and/or imprecise.9 From the authors’ perspectives, the sudden importance of the NHK-Fintiv factors has engendered time consuming and expensive ancillary disputes—frequently in the form of reply and sur-reply briefs—with the parties often disagreeing not only on the relevant facts that should be considered, but also on the proper manner in which to conduct of the NHK-Fintiv analysis.The Growing Clamor for the PTAB to Revisit its Discretionary Denial AnalysisThe PTAB elevated the NHK-Fintiv factors to “precedential” status on May 5, 202010 (having elevated the NHK decision to that status about a year earlier),11 and the impact of that decision has since reverberated loudly within the PTAB bar and beyond.12 Intriguingly, the NHK-Fintiv analysis has even elicited respectful dissent from within the APJ bench, which is rare for the PTAB. In one notable example, an experienced and distinguished APJ13 dissented from the majority’s denial of institution in view of parallel litigation in the Eastern District of Texas, concluding his detailed analyses with the following lucid observations:I also take note of Fintiv’s statement that our evaluation of the factors should be based on “a holistic view of whether efficiency and integrity of the system are best served by denying or instituting review.” Fintiv at 6. And in this sense, a weighing of individual factors aside, I cannot agree with the majority that denying institution here best serves the efficiency and integrity of the patent system. The Petitioner here did exactly what Congress envisioned in providing for inter partes reviews in the America Invents Act: upon being sued for infringement, and having received notice of the claims it was alleged to infringe, it diligently filed a Petition with the Board, seeking review of the patentability of those claims in the alternative tribunal created by the AIA. . . . The inter partes review would proceed, necessarily having a narrower scope than the infringement trial before the district court, and would resolve in an efficient manner the patentability questions so that the district court need not take them up. I fail to see how this outcome would be inconsistent with the “efficiency and integrity of the system.”14While some parties have challenged the NHK-Fintiv analysis in its entirety,15 other stakeholders have acknowledged the PTAB’s statutory authority to exercise its discretion, but have nonetheless criticized the Board’s rulemaking process:The Original Plaintiffs also ask this Court to set aside the current way the Director exercises such discretion because it did not arise through notice-and-comment rulemaking. This implicates the Small Business Inventors’ need for clear regulations promulgated lawfully by the Director that preserves and improves (not eliminates) the Director’s full powers of discretionary denial.16 ― The PTAB is increasingly refusing to institute otherwise-meritorious IPR petitions for purely procedural reasons. And it is doing so through self-declared precedential decisions that promulgate new PTAB policies without notice-and-comment rulemaking or the possibility of judicial review. . . . Congress could also encourage the PTAB to engage in traditional rulemaking when setting new policy for how and when to exercise its discretion, as the Federal Circuit and commenters have also indicated they should.17― Precedential decisions NHK and Fintiv have not translated to predictability. Both decisions provide “non-exclusive” factors that are to be “weighed” as a part of a “balanced assessment”. What does this mean? No one knows. How is a factor to be scored and how much weight does each get and what score will assure or prevent denial of institution? A sample of recent institution decisions illustrates the problem.... There are many other apparently conflicting decisions which are altogether undecipherable. The analysis under NHK and Fintiv has only added complexity and unpredictability to the institution decision. Clear and unambiguous rules would alleviate this and achieve the intended purpose of §314(a) and §316(b).18While the authors purposely do not weigh in on any pending litigation, PTAB proceeding, USPTO petition, or Congressional activity, they believe that it is likely that the USPTO will—at some point in the future, whether through formal rulemaking or otherwise—re-address the factors that the PTAB should consider in deciding whether to discretionarily deny institution of an IPR or PGR petition in view of co-pending parallel litigation.The Proposed “Babcock-Train” Discretionary Denial Factors In View of Co-Pending Parallel LitigationIn light of the foregoing discussion, the authors propose that the PTAB de-designate the NHK-Fintiv factors as precedential authority,19 and in their place adopt (via formal rulemaking or otherwise) an alternative set of non-exhaustive discretionary denial factors as follows (in decreasing order of weight):1) Alacrity of the Petitioner – The timing between service of the complaint in the parallel district court or ITC litigation, and the filing of the PTAB petition.Guidance: The longer the petitioner’s delay beyond four (4) months of service of the complaint, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this factor should be nearly dispositive in favor of institution for timely filed PGRs.Commentary: The petitioner should be afforded a reasonable opportunity after service of the complaint to evaluate the asserted patent and, inter alia, collect and review the prior art, consult with an expert witness, and prepare the petition and supporting declaration. The authors suggest that four (4) months (⅓ of the statutory 1-year time bar for IPRs under 35 U.S.C. § 315(b)) is a reasonable and expeditious time frame for filing a PTAB petition.A PGR petition must be filed within nine months of a first-to-file patent’s issue date. 35 U.S.C. § 321(c). The AIA legislative history emphasizes the importance of having the PTAB review PGRs early in the life of the challenged patent, before expensive district court litigation ensues.20 Accordingly, the PTAB should have a very strong (and likely absolute) interest in reviewing a timely filed PGR petition.2) Merits of the Petition – The strength of the collective patentability challenge. Guidance: The weaker the merits of the collective patentability challenge, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. The term “collective patentability challenge” is used consistently with the PTAB’s institution analysis under the SAS Institute decision21 (i.e., at least one ground and one claim).Commentary: The USPTO should have a strong interest in reevaluating an issued patent when the petition convincingly demonstrates that the challenged patent is, at least in part, defective. Elevating the merits-based consideration (from the catch-all Factor 6 in the NHK-Fintiv analysis) is essential in order for the USPTO to play its important patentability gatekeeper role as mandated by Congress in the AIA.3) Litigation History of the Challenged Patent – The frequency of assertion of the challenged patent, including assertion in the U.S. district courts and the ITC. Guidance: The more frequently the challenged patent has been asserted beyond one time, the more this factor weighs against discretionary denial, and vice versa.Commentary: The USPTO should have a strong interest in reevaluating an issued patent when it has been asserted frequently, including formally (e.g., in the U.S. district courts and the ITC) and informally (e.g., cease and desist letters, which indicate a likelihood of future formal assertion). The potential for divergent district court and ITC claim construction and invalidity determinations highlights the USPTO’s role of providing a uniform patentability analysis. Further, the TC Heartland decision,22 which has resulted in the distribution of patent infringement cases in a significantly greater number of venues, increases the likelihood of divergent district court decisions regarding an asserted patent.This factor assumes that the challenged patent has been asserted once, namely, in the co-pending parallel litigation. In addition, the inclusion of informal assertions in this factor is not intended to affect the PTAB’s limited discovery practices and public disclosure requirements. Rather, consideration of informal assertions should be permitted to indicate the potential for future litigation.4) Longevity of the Challenged Patent – The remaining time until the challenged patent’s expiration. Guidance: The shorter the challenged patent’s remaining life, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa.Commentary: A patent with a longer life poses a larger potential for future disputes, and thus the PTAB should have a greater interest in evaluating a patentability challenge to a patent with a longer remaining term. The policy considerations for Babcock-Train Factor 3, as discussed above, also apply to this factor.5) Section 315 Estoppel Effects – The extent to which the accused defendants in the litigation will be estopped under 35 U.S.C. § 315(e)(2) with respect to the PTAB challenges as applied to the petitioner, its privies, and the RPIs in the PTAB proceeding. Guidance: The lesser the extent of the estoppel on the relevant parties, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. The Panel should disregard additionally named and/or omitted parties in the parallel district court or ITC litigation who do not materially affect the substance of the principal infringement and invalidity allegations. Also, the Panel should disregard any district court or ITC invalidity allegations that would not have been permitted in the PTAB challenge.Commentary: Certainly Congress’ intent in establishing IPR and PGR reviews was to provide an alternative forum for evaluating certain patent validity (patentability) challenges, and generally to allow the petitioner with a single bite at that proverbial apple. To the extent that the PTAB proceeding will not effectively accomplish that “single bite” purpose, then the USPTO should have less interest in instituting trial. Note, however, that parties should not be able to “game” this factor by naming and/or deleting parties in the parallel district court or ITC litigation who do not substantively affect the principal infringement and invalidity allegations. And permissible district court or ITC validity assertions that would not be permitted in the PTAB challenge (e.g., a Section 101 challenge in an IPR) should not be considered in this factor.6) Stage of the District Court or ITC Proceeding(s) – The prospective stage of the parallel district court or ITC litigation beyond Markman as of the scheduled date for the PTAB’s DI. Guidance: The further the parallel district court or ITC litigation will have likely progressed beyond the Markman proceedings at the expected date of the DI, the more this factor weighs in favor of discretionary denial, and vice versa. If the district court or ITC has granted a stay, this factor will weigh against discretionary denial, but not vice versa.Commentary: In conjunction with Factor 1, this factor assumes that most parallel district or ITC cases will have been proceeding for about 10 months at the expected date for the PTAB’s Decision on Institution (“DI”), and thus have begun (and possibly completed) the Markman stage of the litigation. This factor also (realistically) assumes that most district courts will not grant a pre-institution stay given the steadily declining IPR/PGR institution rate (currently ∼55%),23 and that the ITC will rarely grant such a stay. But in consideration of efficiency and notice to the district court or ITC, defendants should be encouraged to seek a stay if they so desire, and they should not be penalized by the PTAB for doing so. This factor also neutralizes the impact of the district court’s or ITC’s Markman proceeding because the parties’ briefing, and the district court’s or ITC’s analysis, regarding claim construction under the common Phillips standard can be readily considered by the PTAB. 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b).A summary of the Babcock-Train Factors is provided in Table 2 below.The Proposed “Babcock-Train” Factors Effectively Incorporate the Salient Considerations of the Current NHK-Fintiv FactorsThe alternative “Babcock-Train” factors set forth above are not oblivious to the considerations that prompted the PTAB to adopt the NHK-Fintiv analysis. Indeed, most of the salient considerations of the NHK-Fintiv factors have been incorporated into the proposed alternative factors.NHK-Fintiv Factor 1 (“whether the court granted a stay or evidence exists that one may be granted if a proceeding is instituted”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor 6.NHK-Fintiv Factor 2 (“proximity of the court’s trial date to the Board’s projected statutory deadline for a final written decision”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor No. 6. At the pre-institution stage, attempting to predict the timing of a district court’s future trial date is very speculative, often little more than an educated and partially informed guess about events more than a year in the future. District courts routinely schedule multiple cases for trial in the same time frame, reasonably expecting that many of those cases will settle at some point before trial (like airlines who routinely overbook flights based on statistical cancellation rates). Accordingly, trial dates are frequently postponed, either by the Court sua sponte or in conjunction with party stipulation.24 The PTAB should not engage in such error-prone speculation, and should not make an important institution decision based on information that is speculative and very likely to become inaccurate after the PTAB issues its DI.The authors appreciate that proposed Babcock-Train Factor 6 (“stage of the district court proceeding”) would also require some speculation by the Board. But by shifting the focus from the distant trial date to the initial Markman proceedings, at the time of the POPR, the proposed forward-looking perspective is only 3 months (not 15 months), which is more likely to be ascertainable. Further, the parties are able to update the Board pre-institution through the submission of Supplemental Information (see 37 C.F.R. § 42.123(c)) or potentially other less formal means. In any event, the authors have included this factor last in the list, partly because of this implicit uncertainty.NHK-Fintiv Factor 3 (“investment in the parallel proceeding by the court and the parties”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been incorporated into Babcock-Train Factors 1 and 6. By filing an expeditious petition (pre-Markman), the investment in the parallel proceeding should be significantly reduced compared to filing a petition on the one-year deadline, which has likely allowed the parallel proceeding to advance beyond Markman.NHK-Fintiv Factor 4 (“overlap between issues raised in the petition and in the parallel proceeding”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor No. 5. In district court litigation, an accused infringer will nearly always assert one or more counterclaims for patent invalidity. If the accused infringer has filed a PTAB petition, those counterclaims will usually (not surprisingly) encompass the same challenges as set forth in the petition. Congress imposed estoppel on a petitioner and its privies only after the PTAB issues a Final Written Decision (“FWD”) (37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b)), so penalizing the petitioner earlier unfairly attempts to broaden the statutory estoppel. Pre-FWD, the petitioner should not be penalized for preserving its rights by raising those same arguments in the parallel district court or ITC litigation, and should not be effectively compelled to make some formal waiver of its litigation invalidity challenges by the PTAB.25NHK-Fintiv Factor 5 (“whether the petitioner and the defendant in the parallel proceeding are the same party”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been effectively incorporated into Babcock-Train Factor 5.NHK-Fintiv Factor 6 (“other circumstances that impact the Board’s exercise of discretion, including the merits”):This NHK-Fintiv Factor has been incorporated into Babcock-Train Factors 1-4. While the authors propose that the Babcock-Train factors should be non-exhaustive, and thus do not suggest that the PTAB should be prohibited from considering other non-enumerated factors when raised by the parties and appropriate, a formal “catch-all” category should not be a discrete factor.A general summary of the relationships between the NHK-Fintiv Factors and the Babcock-Train Factors is provided in Table 3 below. In that table, the authors have endeavored to illustrate where each NHK-Fintiv Factor has been fully or partially incorporated into one or more of the Babcock-Train Factors.Let the Constructive Dialog Continue...The authors hope that the “Babcock-Train” factors proposed herein will provide a solid basis for continuing the dialog regarding the manner in which the Board should—or should not—invoke its discretion to deny a PTAB petition in view of co-pending parallel district court litigation.Table 2Table 31 The authors’ naming of these factors reflects that the entire analyses herein are solely the personal views of the authors, and should not be attributed in any way to Womble Bond Dickinson or any of its clients.2General Plastic Indus.

Brooke Jackson of the District of Colorado ordered the law firm and its client, the Howmedica Osteonics Corp., to pay their litigation opponent’s share of the costs of a special master appointed to oversee discovery.Howmedica Osteonics should pay half of the opponent’s special master costs for failing to preserve text messages, Jackson said in his May 10 opinion. Seyfarth should pay the other half for discovery misconduct by counsel that included “playing fast and loose” with discovery obligations, Jackson said.Jackson also said he was admonishing counsel.“This was a large, important case for both parties,” Jackson said. “The parties were entitled to zealous advocacy from their outside counsel and from their inside corporate attorneys. However, zealous advocacy does not justify abusive conduct or hiding the ball.”Howmedica Osteonics is a subsidiary of the Stryker Corp.Stryker’s counsel “turned this case sour with nasty litigation tactics,” Jackson said.The case involved a contract dispute between Howmedica Osteonics and the plaintiff, a company hired to help sell Howmedica Osteonics’ medical-implant products. Jackson entered judgment for the plaintiff, ORP Surgical, ordered Howmedica Osteonics to pay $4.7 million in damages, and ordered Howmedica Osteonics to pay ORP Surgical’s attorney fees, as called for in the breached contract.Jackson referred to Howmedica Osteonics by the name of its parent company, the Stryker Corp., throughout the opinion.“I find Stryker’s purported excuses for terminating the joint contract for ‘cause’ to be flimsy and lacking in credibility,” Jackson said.Among the special master’s findings regarding discovery:• Stryker failed to preserve text messages sent by an area vice president and a sales manager. After the special master recommended spoliation sanctions, “the missing text messages turned up,” Jackson said. The failure to preserve text messages “was either willful misconduct or gross negligence,” Jackson said.• A Seyfarth Shaw lawyer behaved inappropriately, disruptively, uncivilly and unprofessionally in defending a Stryker recruiter during a deposition. The special master recommended a reprimand.• Stryker lawyers improperly coached and insufficiently prepared their witnesses who were supposed to testify about compensation of sales reps. The witnesses “declined to answer questions about compensation and indemnification either because they were unprepared or because objections and instructions from Stryker’s counsel encouraged them to stonewall the questioner,” Jackson said.• Stryker fell significantly short of its obligation to completely disclose relevant documents in a timely manner.Stryker had contended that any late-disclosed documents were the result of technical difficulties.A spokesperson for Seyfarth Shaw did not immediately respond to the ABA Journal’s request for comment.Hat tip to Law.com, which had coverage of the sanction."

""This measure, if enacted, would significantly weaken the towns legal position as we enter into litigation.""More:Weymouth Town Council takes big action on Route 3 billboardsMembers of the anti-billboard advocacy group Friends of Finnell filed a petition to eliminate the billboard district on Feb. 7.The measure requested the elimination of a billboard overlay zoning district that would allow digital signs built at 613 Pleasant St. and 0 Finnell Drive.Friends of Finnell stated they filed the petition in response to concerns about ""inadequate light-blocking technology"" installed on a digital sign near Route 3 at 611 Pleasant St. by Cove Outdoor Advertising last summer.More:Weymouth residents group want billboard zoning district abolishedTown Council President Arthur Mathews said the Council couldn’t discuss Hedlund’s veto during a March 21 meeting because of town charter regulations.“It’s not on our agenda...because Town Council cant take action for 10 days after the veto,"" he said. ""The 10th day would be [March 22]""Mathews said he plans for the Council to discuss the veto during the April 4 meeting.""We will see how it plays out,"" he said. ""We will talk about the zoning and the mitigation as well. The discussion about the mitigation could go into executive session, but not the discussion about the zoning.""Remediation of Route 3 billboard ‘not completed’Mathews said remediation work on a digital sign on Route 3 at 611 Pleasant St. had “not been completed"" by Cove Outdoor Advertising.“If you speak to neighborhood representatives on Century Road, they will say its not been done, he said.More:Weymouth still battling controversial Route 3 billboard, says company violated agreement.Cove lowered the sign approximately 20 feet, but neighbors and officials say the light-blocking technology isnt shielding nearby homes from the billboard.More:Long-awaited Weymouth billboard lowering underwayTown officials allege Cove failed to place effective light-blocking technology on the billboard, and they turned the sign back on without Weymouth’s approval.“Vetoing measure keeps pressure on Cove”Hedlund stated he vetoed the measure because the billboard relocation zoning has “a 60-day cure period” for owners of digital signs to remedy problematic billboards.“That period ends Monday, March 21, 2022,” he stated. “Enacting the measure would provide Cove a potential legal argument not to perform under the agreement they signed and promised to do, including full and complete remediation of the 611 Pleasant St. billboard. Vetoing this measure keeps the pressure on Cove to fully perform.”Hedlund stated eliminating the billboard overlay district might encourage Cove to accuse town officials of interference during the remediation period in the agreement.""Please consider how the measure will not help our efforts in any lengthy and costly legal battle,"" he stated. ""After the town files litigation against Cove, I will refile this measure exactly as submitted to me by the Council and sign it upon Council approval.""Cove CEO Ed OSullivan said the date for the end of the ""cure period"" to complete the remediation agreement is in mid-April.""I got certified mail from the town solicitor on Valentines day Feb. 14,"" he said.

Litigation,https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/weymouth-news/2022/03/22/weymouth-on-verge-of-litigation-with-bilboard-companycove-outdoor-advertising/9456120002/,Three Considerations for Defendants in NPE Patent Litigation,"The first that many companies hear about patent litigation filed by a non-practicing entity (“NPE”) is when they receive a complaint initiating litigation. And the chances of being on the receiving end of NPE litigation are trending upward.According to a detailed report from patent acquisition company RPX Corp., the first quarter of 2022 marked the second-highest first quarter for NPE activity since 2015.The upward trend may be continuing in view of BlackBerry’s announcement in January that it divested nearly all of its non-core legacy patents to an NPE for $600 million, and assignments indicating other recent large portfolio acquisitions by NPEs such as Dominion Harbor.If a company is sued by an NPE, there are several considerations from the outset that should be weighed in developing a litigation and resolution strategy:Understand the PlaintiffNPEs can be roughly divided into two groups.The first group of NPEs is the high-volume, quick-settlement plaintiffs. By and large, these NPEs are behind the recent uptick in patent litigation. For example, patent monetization company IP Edge was responsible for adding around 144 of the 525 defendants added to patent litigation in the first quarter of 2022. NPEs in this group are prolific filers, but generally pursue early settlements, often even before a responsive pleading has been filed.The second group of NPEs target fewer companies, are backed by litigation funders, and are prepared to pursue cases toward higher value resolutions or judgments. The volume of filings by NPEs in this group has been generally flat over the past few years. However, for defendants, these cases often hold greater risk because the NPE is prepared to drive cases forward and hold out for higher settlements.With this understanding, as soon as a complaint is received, a defendant should learn as much about the plaintiff as possible. Most named plaintiff NPEs are simply shell companies for the actual NPE. So, it is important to find who is behind the litigation. Look at assignment records for the plaintiff’s patents, not just those being asserted in litigation. Search the federal court PACER system to learn where and how often the plaintiff has filed patent litigation, and how long it takes for these cases to be resolved. A simple Google search will often reveal the plaintiff’s reputation for serial patent litigation and may also provide clues to the true NPE.Using this initial research, the defendant can understand the plaintiff’s level of aggressiveness and the likelihood of early resolution, and categorize the NPE accordingly. This information is essential to forming a responsive strategy.Understand the CourtApproximately half of all NPE-filed patent litigation in the U.S. is filed in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas.For years, the Eastern District of Texas was a major hub of NPE filing and patent litigation in general, thanks in large part to the court’s rules of procedure for patent cases. These rules set forth a quick timeline for patent litigation, creating a so-called “rocket docket.”The Supreme Court’s 2017 decision in TC Heartland v. Kraft Foods, 137 S. Ct. 1514, narrowing the definition of “residence” of a company for purposes of establishing venue for patent litigation, led to a decrease in NPE litigation in the Eastern District of Texas. However, it remains a popular jurisdiction among NPE plaintiffs.In the last three years, the Waco division of the Western District of Texas has quickly become another popular venue for NPE plaintiffs, largely due to the appointment of Judge Alan Albright in 2018 and his adoption of patent local rules that are very similar to those in the Eastern District. The RPX report, for example, noted Judge Albright’s “restrictive posture toward various defensive motions” and “idiosyncratic approach” to motions to transfer.Notably, in these two Texas districts, the rules drive patent litigation to trial quickly, often faster than an Inter Partes review—one common tactic for defendants to challenge the validity of patents asserted against them—before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.One strategy to protect a company from NPE litigation is to stay out or move out of these districts, as some companies reportedly have done. If there is an option for where to locate facilities, such as offices or even server banks, consider avoiding these districts.If that is not a practical possibility, when a suit is filed by an NPE in one of these jurisdictions, consider filing a motion to transfer venue to another district where, for example, your company’s headquarters is located. Additionally, in the Western District of Texas, companies may have a physical presence in Austin, Texas. Judge Albright draws cases filed in Waco, Texas, where NPEs file the vast majority of Western District cases. A company with an Austin presence should consider requesting an intra-district transfer from Waco to Austin. If transferred, it will result in a different judge hearing the case and different patent local rules being applied.If your case will be going forward in the Eastern or the Waco division of the Western District of Texas, it is important to understand upfront that there will be challenges. For example, dispositive motions are statistically less likely to be successful. While they can be part of the litigation strategy, they should not be a centerpiece. It is smart to expect that the case will proceed to trial and prepare the case for the long haul from early on. Part of that long-term strategy should include working with counsel who are experienced with litigation in the jurisdiction and have demonstrated success at trial in these venues.Understand your StrategyIn the early days (i.e., before the passage of the America Invents Act in 2012), many defendants applied a scorched earth litigation approach to any and all patent litigation. This strategy often included extensive discovery and motion practice often with little to show for the resources expended.NPEs have evolved in the years since, with strategic responses to the AIA as well as the embrace of litigation funding. As a result, effective defense strategies have become more refined as well. From the outset, companies should consider the end game including prospects for both settlement and trial. Rather than resource-wasting motion practice in jurisdictions where such motions are likely to have little effect, a company should work with its counsel early on to identify the key weaknesses in the plaintiff’s case and understand the issues that are most likely to drive resolution. At the same time, companies that face the more serious cases should immediately begin preparing a solid trial story that will then be developed through discovery.Even when facing a high-volume NPE, one camp of defendants—wary of becoming a “corporate ATM” for NPEs—have taken a hard line against settling with NPEs. Newegg, for example, became well-known for its zero-tolerance policy in the mid-2010s. The Newegg approach, while effective at reducing the NPE threat over the long term, requires both the stomach to fight litigation all the way to trial and the consistency to follow this strategy over the course of multiple cases. The strategy requires at least a few years of consistent defense of NPE cases. In addition, while it is common for joint defense groups to form among multiple defendants facing similar claims from the same NPE, this type of defendant will often need to go it alone while most other defendants settle.Given recent trends, we are in another expansion of NPE litigation with far more investment behind this uptick than prior waves. Although it might not be possible to keep out of the NPE crosshairs entirely, asking the right questions to develop an early and comprehensive strategy will help protect your company"
Litigation,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/three-considerations-for-defendants-in-2541880/,"Huawei, InterDigital enter licensing pact, end patent litigation; InterDigital surges","(Reuters) - InterDigital Inc, a developer of digital mobile and video technology, said on Tuesday it has entered a worldwide patent licensing agreement with China’s Huawei Technologies Ltd, and that the companies have settled all litigation against each other.FILE PHOTO: A cameraman records during Huawei stream product launch event in Barcelona, Spain February 24, 2020. REUTERS/Nacho DoceShares of InterDigital rose as much as 19.2%.In a regulatory filing, InterDigital said the licensing agreement runs through 2023, and covers royalties from the sale of some of Huawei’s 3G, 4G and 5G wireless telecommunications products.InterDigital said the companies have also ended more than 15 months of litigation in China and the United Kingdom.Huawei had sued InterDigital in January 2019 in the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court in China, claiming that the Wilmington, Delaware-based company was licensing its patents on unfair terms, according to a separate regulatory filing.InterDigital countered in December 2019 with its own action before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, accusing Huawei of infringing five patents related to industry standards for 3G, 4G and 5G telecommunications.Talks to renew an earlier Huawei license had broken down, and the UK court would serve as a “neutral venue” to address the dispute, InterDigital said at the time.Patent royalties accounted for about 96% of InterDigital’s revenue in 2019. InterDigital said a typical royalty might be $1.15 on a 3G or 4G smartphone that costs $500.Terms to resolve the disputes were not disclosed. Huawei had no immediate comment.In afternoon trading, InterDigital shares were up $7.85, or 15.7%, at $58.00, after earlier rising to $59.79."
Litigation,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-climate-change-lawsuits/,,"Cryptocurrency litigation is soaring, prompted by a surge of investors in the space, and US proposals promise more rules to fight over in coming months and years.Crypto has generated more than 200 class action lawsuits and other private litigation as of this month, up more than 50% since the start of 2020, according to Morrison Cohen, which tracks the activity. Half of all crypto litigation are class actions or private suits, according to the firm’s data.PODCAST:Listen to Sam talk more about this story on our weekly legal news podcast“There’s been a steady stream of cases from regulators, but what’s really exploded is private litigation,” said Jason Gottlieb, chair of Morrison Cohen’s white collar and regulatory enforcement practice group in New York.The rise in litigation is encouraging Big Law operations to bolster their crypto practices. Firms including Jenner & Block, Goodwin Procter, and Morrison & Foerster in the last few months have added new crypto partners to their rosters, including former fraud prosecutors, securities litigators and investment funds lawyers.The litigation growth comes at a tumultuous time for crypto. A backer of the collapsed TerraUSD stablecoin lost $3 billion in cryptocurrency reserves in a failed effort to restore its peg to the dollar, Bloomberg News reported Monday. Bitcoin on May 12 hit its lowest level since 2020 and was down 50% from its November high, according to Bloomberg.Perkins Coie has so much activity on the crypto front that it holds weekly team calls, typically including 50 to 70 firm attorneys, said Joe Cutler, firmwide co-chair of the firm’s fintech industry group. “We have content coming out of our ears,” he said.At Latham & Watkins, more than 700 lawyers worked on crypto or blockchain issues in 2021 alone, said Yvette Valdez, co-chair of the firm’s global digital assets and Web3 practice.“The market is exploding, not just at the partner level but at the associate level too,” Valdez said.The result is a buyer’s market for lawyers, as firms see colleagues leave for general counsel positions at crypto companies, said Joshua Ashley Klayman, U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets for Linklaters in New York.The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance Holdings Ltd., is looking to hire more than 30 lawyers, Bloomberg Law reported Monday. Another cryptocurrency exchange, Bittrex Global GmbH, hired a Shearman & Sterling senior associate late last year to be its general counsel.“There’s seemingly a fire hose of work that could, and does, come in,” Klayman said.Crypto RulesNew US government crypto polices in progress promise even more work for firms.US lawmakers, including Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are proposing legislation. Toomey last month released a draft proposal to set new rules for stablecoins, Bloomberg News reported.Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Ross Behnam said last week that federal regulators are considering steps they can take if Congress fails to act. US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has said he believes most digital assets are subject to his rules and that he’s beefing up enforcement.Upcoming rules are “going to generate a ton of litigation,” said Mark Califano, a partner with Dentons and an independent director of the crypto exchange Bitstamp USA Inc.The LawsuitsThe crypto lawsuits keeping firms busy touch on commercial matters, employment, and business failures that sometimes involve bankruptcies.Celebrities, and even a famed French fashion house, became enmeshed in private legal actions.Plaintiffs in early January filed a putative class action against Kim Kardashian, former boxing champ Floyd Mayweather Jr., and others in Heugerich v. Gentile. The suit alleges the defendants made false and misleading statements in social media posts to investors of the cryptocurrency token EthereumMax.One week later, Hermes International, the Paris-based maker of scarves, women’s bags and other lifestyle accessories, sued Mason Rothschild in federal court in Manhattan. The suit alleges trademark infringement of the company’s Birkin bag trademarks.The defendant allegedly created and sold METABIRKINS NFTs, short for “non-fungible tokens,” or non-replicable, digital collectible items, in the augmented or virtual-reality “metaverse.”Some of the suits involve initial coin offerings and questions over whether the bits are really unregistered securities offerings, Gottlieb said. The SEC is examining creators of NFTs and the exchanges where they trade to determine if some of the assets run afoul of agency rules, Bloomberg News reported in March.WATCH: Tax Your Crypto and NFTs? Yes, the IRS Wants Its CutCrypto PracticesAt most firms, crypto efforts are structured as interdisciplinary groups that involve partners—and increasingly, associates—from existing firm practices.The lawyers working on crypto have specialties such as tax, banking, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, data privacy, and patents and intellectual property.Their efforts run the gamut from business formations and dissolutions, to regulatory work and litigation, Klayman said. Specific matters include everything from writing letters to the SEC to keeping clients aware of regulations and disputes, she said.Firms try to make clients aware of how to get on the right side of regulations before the company is targeted, said Judie Rinearson, co-chair of the global fintech group at K&L Gates.“It takes a special lawyer-client relationship to navigate regulations and laws that are a little gray or unclear,” Rinearson said. “You want to be the good guy in this.”‘High-End Counsel’Despite the recent downturn in crypto value, firms said they’re optimistic about the future of their practices, with new venture capital and private equity investments padding crypto companies.“Money is still pouring into crypto,” Cutler said. Despite last week’s drops, “I’ve yet to get a panic call,” he said.He termed crypto value declines as corrections that need to be put in perspective. “When people focus on days, weeks, or months, and not years, it’s easy for them to conclude it’s wildly volatile,” Cutler said. “But it’s not true.”Andrew Ceresney, co-chair of Debevoise & Plimpton’s litigation department, said his firm sees no shortage of paying crypto clients.“In the beginning, there weren’t many crypto companies that had the means to be able to afford us,” Ceresney said. “Now, more and more crypto companies are able to afford high-end legal counsel.”"
Litigation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-interdigital-huawei-tech-settlement-idUSKCN22A31B,,"Pinterest Inc., the social scrapbooking platform that has been a possible acquisition target, is losing its general counsel Oct. 1, the company disclosed in a securities filing.Christine Flores will assist Pinterest in the “orderly transition” of her duties as the company initiates a search to find her replacement, the Wednesday filing said.Pinterest hired her from Google to be its legal chief in 2017. She had joined Alphabet Inc.s Google in 2007 and spent the next decade there, rising to the level of vice president of legal before being recruited by San Francisco-based Pinterest.Flores is set to exit Pinterest roughly a year to the month that PayPal Holdings Inc. said it wasn’t interested in a potential $45 billion acquisition of the company. Microsoft Corp. also reportedly expressed takeover interest in Pinterest last year.Flores has been a “valued member” of Pinterest’s executive ranks, said spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins Thompson, who cited her work taking the company public in 2019.Pinterest’s initial public offering raised $1.4 billion and generated $2 million in legal fees for the company’s securities lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and Delaware’s Potter Anderson & Corroon.“Christine will be involved in identifying the new general counsel and facilitating a seamless transition,” Thompson said.Pinterest’s most recent proxy statement shows that Flores received almost $4.8 million in total compensation during fiscal 2020. More than $4.4 million of that sum was comprised of stock awards. Flores’ annual base salary was $345,000.Securities filings show that within the past year Flores has sold off more than $17.8 million in Pinterest stock. She currently owns Pinterest shares valued at roughly $7.3 million, according to Bloomberg data.Flores began her career as a corporate associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which advised underwriters on Pinterest’s IPO, and Proskauer Rose.Her Google role saw Flores oversee 100 lawyers, as well as corporate governance, ethics and compliance, legal operations, mergers and acquisitions, real estate, and securities work.At Pinterest, she oversaw changes to her legal team.The company saw longtime deputy general counsel Anthony Falzone depart last year to become the top lawyer at Clubhouse, a privately held social media app. Pinterest also hired former Twitter litigation head Michele Lee for a position that put her in charge of the company’s litigation, regulatory, and employment teams.Bloomberg News reported in October that PayPal approached Pinterest about a potential purchase at $70 per share. The aborted deal would have been PayPal’s largest-ever acquisition. Paypal’s longtime legal chief A. Louise Pentland stepped down at year’s end.In November, Pinterest agreed to spend $50 million to promote diversity and inclusion initiatives at the company over the next 10 years as part of a settlement of lawsuits filed by investors.Pinterest hired Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr to investigate its workplace culture in 2020 after two former female Black employees on its public policy team left the company amid accusations of racial bias and unfair pay.Francoise Brougher, Pinterest’s former COO, sued the company later that year alleging that she was fired after pointing out gender discrimination in a male-dominated C-suite. Brougher, who claimed she was paid less than her male peers, secured a $20 million settlement from Pinterest in late 2020.Pinterest admitted no wrongdoing in that deal but pledged to commit $2.5 million for programs improving representation in the technology industry.A walkout by more than 350 Pinterest employees in the aftermath of Brougher’s lawsuit saw the company make changes to its board in an effort to diversify its corporate leadership."
