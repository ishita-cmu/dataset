Cosmetics giant Revlon filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday evening as it grappled with a cumbersome debt load and a snarled supply chain.,1
"The company said it expects to receive $575 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing lender base, which will help to support its day-to-day operations.",0
"Revlon's bankruptcy filing said the company is currently unable to timely fill almost one-third of customer demand for its products, due to an inability to source a ""sufficient and regular supply of raw materials.""",1
"Shipping components from China to the United States takes Revlon eight to 12 weeks and costs four times 2019 prices, it said.",0
Revlon is the first major consumer-facing business to file for bankruptcy protection in what has been a yearslong pause of distress in the retail sector.,1

"In late 2020, as stuck-at-home consumers dramatically curtailed their spending on beauty items, Revlon narrowly avoided bankruptcy when enough bondholders took part in its debt restructuring program.",0
The company had warned in early November of that year that it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 protection.,1
"Though the business rebounded in 2021, Revlon's revenue is still below pre-pandemic levels.",0
Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes acquired Revlon in a hostile takeover for about $1.8 billion in 1985.,0
"The business grew over the years through acquisitions, including of Coty's Cutex business and Elizabeth Arden.",0

"Alongside this, the opportunities for Paper Source to work with Barnes & Noble are tremendously exciting for both businesses,"" Daunt said in a press release.",0
"The stationery chain filed for bankruptcy on March 2 and was forced to close stores, cut jobs and reduce the pay of senior managers.",1
"Like many retailers, Paper Source's sales fell last year due to Covid pandemic shutdowns, capacity restrictions, and a wave of canceled weddings and events hurt sales of invitations.",0

Chief Executive Anko van der Werff said the strike had accelerated its decision to file for Chapter 11 status.,1
"Sydbank analysts estimated, in a worst-case scenario, it could erase up to half of its cash flow in the initial four to five weeks alone.",0
"""The pilots may well consider themselves pieces in the puzzle that legalizes the management's Chapter 11 request, and it's doubtful whether it will bring them back to the negotiating table,"" Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen said.",1
"""On the other hand, the Chapter 11 request also shows how serious the situation is for SAS.""",1
"Entering Chapter 11 would make it easier for the company to lay off employees, experts say.",1
"""It does not affect the strike or our agreements,"" he said.",0
The airline said the U.S. bankruptcy protection filing was aimed at accelerating a restructuring plan announced in February.,1
"The strike is grounding roughly half the airline's flights, affecting some 30,000 passengers per day, it said.",0
"SAS expects to complete the Chapter 11 process in nine to 12 months, it added.",1
SAS shares can be traded as normal during the bankruptcy proceedings.,1

"SAS needs to attract new investors and has said to do that it must slash costs across the company, including for leased planes that stand idle because of closed Russian airspace and a slow recovery in Asia.",0
The airline predicted its cash balance of 7.8 billion Swedish crowns was sufficient to meet its business obligations in the near term.,0
Nordnet analyst Per Hansen said the U.S. application showed SAS needs a fresh start and that it thinks the strike will drag on.,0

One of the most high-profile disputes triggered by the bankruptcy of collapsed Richmond law firm LeClairRyan has been officially resolved.,1
Judge Kevin Huennekens last week formally approved a $21 million settlement that puts to rest the litigation between the LeClairRyan bankruptcy estate and legal services giant UnitedLex.,1
The largest chunk would be $12.3 million in insurance proceeds from a policy through insurer CNA that covered UnitedLex.,0

"With its stratospheric $47 billion valuation and preposterously ambitious cofounder and CEO, Adam Neumann — his goal wasn't merely to make money or rent office space, he claimed, but to ""change the world"" — WeWork had become a glaring symbol of Silicon Valley's boundless audacity and self-professed exemption from the laws of economics.",0
"Almost immediately, all hell broke loose.",0
What was supposed to be Neumann's coronation as a visionary became one of the most catastrophically bungled attempted debuts in business history.,0
The most brilliant minds in Silicon Valley and the most powerful global investors had shoveled billions of dollars into its coffers — how could it be anything but a sure bet?,0
But two things had changed in the nine years since Neumann began constructing the myth of WeWork with the help of starry-eyed tech journalists and hungry investors: Theranos and Uber.,0

The company didn't explain how it would become profitable.,0
The potential conflicts were astounding: Neumann owned an interest in four buildings that WeWork leased.,0
"One, for $362 million, was connected to an early exercise of stock options (and has since been repaid).",0
"Perhaps most alarmingly, he had purchased the trademark to the ""We"" name through a holding company, and WeWork paid him $5.9 million to license it.",0
"It led a $32 million investment into the surfer Laird Hamilton's startup, Laird Superfood, and sank $14 million into Wavegarden, a company that makes surfing-wave pools.",0
"WeWork would have three classes of stock, including two that awarded Neumann 20 votes for each share.",0
But perhaps what made WeWork different is the apparent problems with the company's business model.,0
"For the first half of this year, losses climbed to $904 million even as revenue doubled to $1.54 billion.",0
"""We have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level,"" the firm said in its filing, ""for the foreseeable future.""",0

"John Coffee, a Columbia University professor who directs the university's corporate-governance center, told the Financial Times that to navigate past investor concerns about the company's structure, market volatility, and a tougher climate for IPOs, Neumann would have to ""go through an ordeal of fire.""",0

WeWork's bonds rallied by more than 3% on hopes that the IPO would pay off.,0

"WeWork's bankers weren't having any luck drumming up enough support for the IPO, hearing from investors concerned about signs of Neumann's self-dealing and skepticism about the business model.",0

Newspapers reported the company was preparing to kick off its IPO road show as soon as the following week.,0
"While some had suggested early on that the company's lofty valuation might need to be trimmed, things had gone quiet as advisers canvassed investors.",0
Yet some company insiders still hoped to be able to get something in the range of $25 billion to $30 billion.,0
"The reasons for the knockdown were well publicized, though members of WeWork's camp tried mightily to paint it as a prudent step: The Financial Times said the firm's underwriters were worried about listing the company at too high a valuation and risking a repeat of what happened with Uber, which has fallen about 33% since its debut.",0
"By Monday, if not before, SoftBank decided it had seen enough.",0
"For SoftBank, it was a stunning reversal.",0
Yet it couldn't stomach a public-market valuation just one-third of the private value it had given WeWork as recently as January.,0
"Neumann was ""desperately"" trying to keep the IPO on track.",0
Friday was a big day.,0
"The company publicly announced changes that day, taking the steps the Financial Times previewed, and made numerous other changes at the same time.",0
"The plan for Rebekah Neumann to choose a successor in the event of her husband's death was also scrapped, and the filing said the board had the ability to remove the CEO.",0
That would value the company at less than the $12.8 billion in total equity it raised during its nine years of operations.,0
"In talks earlier that week with SoftBank, the CEO said he didn't expect any changes over the coming 12 months and what he really needed was more cash to fund his plans for expansion.",0
"Later that Friday, the firm announced plans to list on the Nasdaq.",0
"The CEO resisted some of his advisers' suggested changes to the IPO filing, particularly around the control and voting structures, one of the people said.",0
"Neumann wasn't even listening to his largest sponsor, SoftBank, who wanted to shelve the IPO.",0
"By Friday afternoon, news reports suggested that SoftBank was prepared to act as the anchor investor in the IPO, purchasing at least $750 million in shares in the offering.",0
It would be some of the longest 48 hours of Adam Neumann's life.,0
The company issued a terse statement that said it looked forward to completing the IPO by the end of the year.,0
"The day after shelving the IPO, Neumann acknowledged in an internal webcast to being humbled.",0
"He now realized, he told his employees, that the skills he'd developed to run a private company would need to be adapted to run a public corporation.",0
"The Wall Street Journal's Eliot Brown dropped a 2,864-word, deeply reported article detailing Neumann's frequent marijuana use and propensity for shots of tequila.",0

"In the coverage that followed across news organizations, the CEO's marijuana use would be frequently mentioned.",0
"Faced with allegations of drug use, erratic behavior, and earlier defiance in pursuing the IPO even after his largest investor cautioned patience, SoftBank had lost faith.",0
Several investors even thought of threatening the CEO with legal steps related to his self-dealing.,0
"Like the consigliere J. Pierpont Morgan a century before, Dimon found himself in the midst of the biggest corporate story of the moment.",0
"Dimon also brokered talks with Neumann's advisers over the course of two days at the bank's midtown headquarters, a person familiar with them said.",0
"In addition to serving as the bank's top IPO adviser, JPMorgan has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Neumann.",0
The CEO had another $98 million from JPMorgan in the form of mortgages and other loans.,0
"Later that Sunday, Neumann had dinner with Bruce Dunlevie, one of WeWork's earliest directors and a partner at the investor Benchmark Capital, to discuss his options.",0
He wanted Neumann out.,0
"On Tuesday, September 24, as Neumann's fate hung in the balance, WeWork's board assembled at JPMorgan's Madison Avenue headquarters.",0
"On floors that towered over Grand Central Terminal, WeWork's board met for hours to discuss what to do.",0
"In the end, Neumann voted against himself.",0
"He had lost control of the company and watched his voting power reduced to three votes a share, giving him a minority of votes.",0
"In a statement, Neumann told employees that ""since the announcement of our IPO, too much of the focus has been placed on me.""",0
"The company began to formalize talks for a renegotiated loan of about $3 billion, which was expected to require the raising of additional equity.",0

"Voyager suffered huge losses from its exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which went bust last week after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry — including $650 million from Voyager.",1
"""We strongly believe in the future of the industry but the prolonged volatility in the crypto markets, and the default of Three Arrows Capital, require us to take this decisive action,"" Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich said in a tweet early Wednesday.",1
