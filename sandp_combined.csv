s&p 500,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/prepare-for-the-us-dollar-hit-on-sp-500-big-tech-earnings.html,"A picture taken on November 7, 2017 shows people arriving at the headquarters of Nike Europe in Hilversum. AFP ContributorWhen athletic apparel giant Nike disclosed on June 27 that a strong U.S. dollar weighed on sales in its most recent quarter and the rising value of the greenback would keep pressuring sales in fiscal 2023, its shares sold off, and gave an early warning to a market already worried about the earnings outlook for the June quarter. That followed a warning from Microsoft that June-quarter sales would be $460 million lower for the same reason, shaving $250 million from profit. Indeed, the dollars 11% gain this year against a basket of currencies – and 12% against the euro – is a looming problem as earnings season kicks into gear. Standard & Poors 500 companies get 29% of their sales from outside the U.S, according to Goldman Sachs. They typically sell those products or services in local currencies, then report financial results including those sales in dollars. So if Nike sells a pair of shoes for 100 euro, it was worth about $7 less at the end of its quarter than at the beginning. The numbers arent massive in percentage terms – Microsofts miss works out to between 1% and 2% of earnings. But in a nervous market where companies stocks get punished for even small earnings misses, they are worth being prepared for, experts say. The markets drop this year has been about investors paying less for each dollar of corporate earnings, says Stacie L. Mintz, head of quantitative equity at PGIM Quantitative Solutions, a unit of Prudential Financial. Currency issues are one of several forces now threatening the earnings themselves. ""Its important because it puts a cloud around earnings season, and this is an important earnings season,"" Mintz said. Currency is only one reason projections of earnings growth are dropping across the board. Expected June-quarter profit growth in consumer discretionary companies, for example, has fallen by more than half since March, as the market overall has seen projected growth slip to 5.2% from 6.3%, CFRA Research strategist Sam Stovall said.The dollar has risen for the reason it often does during global economic weakness, seen as the worlds reserve currency, and the safest bet in town. Concerns about higher interest rates and the threat to stocks from an economic growth slowdown, if not an outright recession, have also prompted gains in the greenback. The euro has borne the brunt of pressure in currency markets, with recession fears especially high in Europe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Economic sanctions against Russia, including a bar on most Russian sales of natural gas to eurozone nations, have raised the cost of fuel and driven overall inflation to 8.6 percent over the last year.Technology earnings and the dollarThe amount of pressure on earnings from currency swings will vary by company and by industry, depending on their mix of business. In general, shares of companies that get most of their sales domestically have outperformed more-global businesses in 2022 by about 9 percentage points, according to a June 22 report by Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin. U.S.-centric companies were down an average of 15%, as companies with higher percentages of foreign sales dropped 24%. At 59% of sales, technology companies have the greatest exposure, according to Goldman. Thats especially true of semiconductor companies, but also affects consumer stocks like Apple and advertising-driven names like Meta Platforms and Alphabet, the parent companies of Facebook and Google, respectively. Materials companies in industries such as paper and chemicals are second at 50%, with health care, financial stocks and utilities having the lowest exposure among the 11 sectors in the markets benchmark large-cap index. Companies with high exposure to foreign sales include Qualcomm (96%), oilfield services company Schlumberger (85%), disability insurer Aflac (70%), Netflix and Meta (59%), and Alphabet at 54%. Companies with high exposure to Europe will likely make the biggest adjustments to revenue for currency. These include Booking Holdings at 79%, Philip Morris International at 39% and aerospace supplier Hexcel at 44%. None of those companies have recently signaled a drop in revenue or profit gains due to currency.Tesla, Apple and overseas currenciesA couple of companies worth watching as this issue develops are Tesla, which gets a quarter of its sales in developing nations like China, and Apple, which gets 19% of sales in Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan) and another 24% in Europe. The bigger impact on Tesla, especially, will come from Chinas zero-Covid policy, which shut down Teslas Shanghai factory for much of the quarter, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. At Apple, the impact will be greater in hardware than in the services business, and will be mitigated by Chinese government interventions to keep the yuan close to stable against the dollar, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. ""Its going to be a [2 percent] to [3 percent] headwind to revenue for major tech players, and could accelerate in the second half,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. ""Its going to result in numbers cuts, including for Tesla and Apple."" The bigger impact for Apple may come in the September quarter, since the dollar has continued to rise since the end of June, Zino said. ""Given an environment where consumer spending may weaken, it could affect how Apple prices products in different parts of the world, Zino said.How companies fight currency volatility"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 164.31 points, or 0.52%, to close at 31,173.84. The S&P 500 fell 1.15% to 3,854.43, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.26% to 11,372.60. ""Its always about earnings,"" said Tim Lesko of Mariner Wealth Advisors. ""The expectation has been for a year now that its not about the trailing earnings, its about the future economic expectations. It really hasnt mattered what people have reported in the way of revenue earnings. Its been the talk that theyve had about how they expect their future business to look.""CNBCJack Ablin, founding partner of Cresset Capital, expects companies to tamp down their forecasts as they grapple with rising prices, slowing growth and an aggressive Federal Reserve. The season kicks off with earnings from PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines on Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by bank stocks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup later in the week. Casino stocks Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands led Mondays losses, falling more than 6% each on the back of worsening Covid trends in China, including a week-long shutdown of casinos in Macau. Shanghai also detected its first case of the BA.5 subvariant. ""COVID headwinds arent just a Chinese phenomenon – cases are climbing globally, although the risk of lockdowns in the US and EU remains extremely low,"" wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge. The consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 slipped nearly 2.8%, while information technology dropped 1.4%. Amazon and Alphabet shed more than 3% each. Tesla slipped 6.5% while Netflix slid nearly 5.2%. Nike, Caterpillar and Walt Disney dropped more than 2%, dragging the Dow lower. Twitter shares fell 11.3% after Elon Musk terminated a deal worth $44 billion to buy the social media company. The billionaire took issue with the number of bots and fake accounts on the platform and said Twitter wasnt being truthful about how authentic activity on the platform was. However, the company said it gave Musk the information he needed to assess the claims. Meanwhile, the 2-year Treasury yield hovered above its 10-year counterpart, an inversion many see as a recession indicator. The 2-year rate on Monday traded at 3.07%, while the 10-year stood at 2.99%."

The consumer price index is seen rising 1.1% m-o-m and 8.8% y-o-yAnother hot CPI report could bolster the case for aggressive Fed tightening, a scenario that may weigh on stocks and other risk assetsMost Read: Active vs Passive Investing: Top Stock Investing TipsU.S. stocks seesawed and struggled for direction for much of the day but pushed sharply lower in late trading, with the energy and tech sector leading the sell-off amid growing fears that the economy could take a turn for the worse and slip into recession at some point this year. When it was all said and done, the S&P 500 sank 0.92% to 3,819, falling for the third straight session and re-entering bear market territory. The Nasdaq 100, for its part, slumped 0.97 % to 11,745, despite the pullback in long-term Treasury rates.Sentiment remains defensive and the mood fragile on Wall Street on mounting economic headwinds, including tighter financial conditions, sky-high inflation, and rapidly downshifting growth. While the labor market continues to be strong, as evidenced by the June employment report, other indicators point to trouble ahead. The sharp slowdown in manufacturing and housing sector, for instance, are two causes for concern.Market-derived signals are also starting to flash red. A notable example is the inversion of the yield curve in the 2-year to 10-year stretch (2s10s). Inversions in this part of the interest rate term structure have foreshadowed economic downturns many times throughout history, with just a couple of exceptions. In any case, developments in the fixed income space, together with recent weakness in growth-linked commodities, is a clear indication that investors are worried about the outlook.Looking ahead, all eyes will be on the June U.S. consumer price index data on Wednesday. Headline CPI is expected to rise 1.1% m-o-m, boosted by soaring gasoline costs, bringing the annual rate to 8.8% from 8.6% previously, the highest level since November 1981. A hot report, similar to the one seen in May, is likely to prompt the Fed to retain a hawkish stance, bolstering the case for front-loaded hikes at upcoming FOMC meetings, despite the negative effect they may have on the GDP profile.Aggressive monetary policy tightening, in response to relentless inflationary pressures, will create a hostile environment for risk assets, preventing stocks from staging a meaningful and sustainable recovery in the near term. Against this backdrop, the financial landscape may get worse before it gets better for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.S&P 500 TECHNICAL ANALYSISThe S&P 500 broke below a technical floor near 3,820 on Tuesday, slipping back into bear-market territory. If sellers maintain control of the market, we could see a move towards 3,735, followed by the 2022 lows. On further weakness, the focus shifts to channel support around the 3,600 psychological level. On the other hand, if dip buyers step in to take advantage of the recent pullback and spark a bullish reversal, the first meaningful resistance to watch appears at 3,950, and 4,065 thereafter.S&P 500 TECHNICAL CHARTS&P 500 Chart Prepared Using TradingView"

They are listed below.The Prudent Speculator is published by Kovitz Investment Group of Chicago and remains at the top of the list for 30-year returns among newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. The TPS portfolio’s average annualized 30-year return is 14.5% through June 30, compared with 9.9% for the S&P 500, with dividends reinvested monthly, according to Hulbert.During an interview, Buckingham explained the role of market psychology in investing: “You don’t want everyone to be euphoric. You want them to be down in the dumps.”The idea is that there is nothing unusual about a 20% decline in stock prices. Broad market declines must be expected and even embraced for long-term success.The Prudent Speculator’s portfolio includes 80 stocks identified as suitable for three- to five-year investments. Starting with about 3,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, Buckingham and his colleagues narrow the list to identify highly liquid, “potentially undervalued” names relative to the market.One aspect of the value strategy is low prices relative to expected earnings. Buckingham said the TPS portfolio’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 10.4 as of July 12. In comparison, the forward P/E ratio for the Russell 1000 Value Index RLV, +0.34% was 13.5 (according to Kovitz, using Bloomberg data) and the forward P/E for the S&P 500 was 16.8 (according to FactSet).There’s more about Buckingham’s long-term view of the market below.

Oh, wait, we are in that parallel universe. CNN notes that both Exxon and Marathon Oil were added to the index at the same time that Tesla was removed.CNBC reported that these changes to the index took effect on May 2, and according to a spokesperson, Tesla’s “lack of a low-carbon strategy” as well as “codes of business conduct” were cited as reasons why.According to the S&P spokesperson, “While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk called into question the integrity of the S&P Global Ratings, calling the ESG a scam being weaponized by phony social justice warriors. That may seem a bit extreme of a take to some, but if you take into account what I’ve noted in this article, it would seem as if the ESG scores are influenced by more than just data.Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 18, 2022Reuters also reported on the matter and on Elon Musk’s response. It included an interview with Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ head of ESG indices for North America. Dorn told Reuters that Tesla’s lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes were factors in the eventual ranking.“You can’t just take a company’s mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions.”Perhaps she’s unaware of Tesla’s Impact Report, which was recently released by the company. When Reuters asked about Elon Musk’s tweet, another representative for the index provider said that the Tesla CEO might have been referring to a list on the company blog that included the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after Tesla and others had been removed. That list included Exxon but not Tesla.In another blog, Dorn shared more details as to why Tesla was excluded.“First and foremost, the GICS industry group in which Tesla is assessed (Automobiles & Components) experienced an overall increase in its average S&P DJI ESG Score. So, while Tesla’s S&P DJI ESG Score has remained fairly stable year-over-year, it was pushed further down the ranks relative to its global industry group peers.4.“A few of the factors contributing to its 2021 S&P DJI ESG Score were a decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla’s (lack of) low carbon strategy5 and codes of business conduct.6 In addition, a Media and Stakeholder Analysis,7 a process that seeks to identify a company’s current and potential future exposure to risks stemming from its involvement in a controversial incident, identified two separate events centered around claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s Fremont factory, as well as its handling of the NHTSA investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot vehicles.“Both of these events had a negative impact on the company’s S&P DJI ESG Score at the criteria level, and subsequently its overall score. While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens.”Are ESG Ratings Even Legit?…A few of the factors contributing to its ESG Score were a decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla’s (lack of) low carbon strategy… And I thought pushing the whole industry toward electrification is a decent low carbon strategy 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/PkvZnGxJ5P — Martin Viecha (@MartinViecha) May 18, 2022In 2013, Greenpeace shared a collage of photos from decades of Exxon oil spills and explosions. Although 2013 is almost a decade ago, it wasn’t too long ago that the Exxon plant near me had an event that sounded like an explosion to all of us, but according to officials was just a fireball. Last year, the same Exxon plant near me was found to produce 350 pounds of particulate matter per hour according to an independent test conducted in January 2020. The Baton Rouge plant produces 517,000 barrels of oil daily and is around five miles from my home.But Tesla gets kicked off the index while Exxon and other oil companies remain?In that previous article, I noted other influences affecting Tesla’s ESG score. I also gave a comparison between Tesla and a few oil companies, including Exxon. To recap, ExxonMobil’s ESG score was worse than Tesla’s. So, how does an oil company with a worse ESG score than Tesla’s get to stay in the S&P 500 ESG Index? We are either living in a parallel universe or perhaps Elon Musk is right about ESG scores.Have a tip for CleanTechnica, want to advertise, or want to suggest a guest for our CleanTech Talk podcast?

s&p 500,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/sp-500-to-exclude-snap-after-voting-rights-debate.html,"The S&P 500 will start excluding companies that issue multiple classes of shares, managers of the index said on Monday, a move that effectively bars Snap after its decision to offer stock with no voting rights.The decision takes effect starting Tuesday, according to a statement by the manager of the widely used benchmark, S&P Dow Jones Indices.Snap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Existing components of the S&P index with several share classes — such as Google parent Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway — will not be affected.""Companies with multiple share class structures tend to have corporate governance structures that treat different shareholder classes unequally with respect to voting rights and other governance issues,"" the index provider said in a statement.The S&P changes, which extend to the S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 indexes, reflect a toughening stance by index firms and the investors they represent who increasingly emphasize the importance of corporate governance rights.That often runs up against the interest of leaders of high-growth, often technology companies that resist coming to public markets and offering full voting rights out of fear they will lose control of their companies.Snaps $3.4 billion March IPO was the third-largest ever for a U.S. tech company but some investors were taken aback by the companys unusual decision to offer new investors a class of common stock with no voting rights.Snap shares had their busiest trading day in two and a half months in a volatile session on Monday, as early investors could sell their shares for the first time since its market debut. The stock pared losses to close down 1 percent at $13.67, after falling as much as 5.1 percent and hitting a record low.FTSE Russell said last week it planned to exclude Snap from its stock indexes.Inclusion in a stock index has been an important milestone for young companies, bringing their shares into many passive funds and others that closely follow indexes like the S&P 500, a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide.The decision likely means that funds like $243 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF will not buy Snap anytime soon."
s&p 500,https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/best-sp-500-index-funds/,"If you want your portfolios value to grow with the U.S. economy and dont want to choose individual stocks, an S&P 500 index fund could be a smart choice. In fact, legendary investor Warren Buffett has said that investing in low-cost S&P 500 index funds is a bet on the future of U.S. economic growth and the best way for most people to build wealth.Image source: Getty Images.What are S&P 500 index funds and why are they popular? An index fund is designed to mirror the performance of a stock index. An S&P 500 index fund invests in each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). It doesnt try to outperform the index; instead, it uses the index as its benchmark and aims to replicate its performance as closely as possible. S&P 500 funds are by far the most popular type of index fund. But index funds can be based on practically any financial market, investing strategy, or stock market sector. Index funds are popular with investors for a number of reasons. They offer easy portfolio diversification, with some funds enabling portfolio exposure to hundreds or even thousands of stocks and bonds. You dont risk losing all your money if one company performs poorly or collapses as you would with individual investments. However, you also dont get exposure to the potentially astronomical returns that can result from picking a single huge winner. Index funds are passively managed, which means youre not paying for someone to actively pick and choose investments.

Youre investing in 500 of the most profitable companies in the U.S. The corporations represented in the S&P 500 are subject to stringent listing criteria. To join the index, a company must have an $11.8 billion market capitalization, and the sum of its past four quarters earnings must be positive. Each company must also get approval from an index committee. The S&P 500s largest holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).The corporations represented in the S&P 500 are subject to stringent listing criteria.

You can put your investment decisions on autopilot. The S&P 500 has a flawless track record of delivering profits over long holding periods, so you can invest without worrying about stock market fluctuations or having to research individual companies. You can simply budget a certain amount and automatically invest it on a regular schedule. This practice is known as dollar-cost averaging. Even if you do pick individual stocks, S&P 500 funds are a good foundation for your investment portfolio since youre guaranteed the returns of the stock market.3 best S&P 500 index funds These three major S&P 500 funds are extremely similar in composition since each tracks the performance of the same index: Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:IVV) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY) All three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- a type of index fund -- invest in the 500 companies that make up the S&P 500 index. Each has very closely replicated the indexs performance:Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data as of May 10, 2022. Fund Name Expense Ratio Total Fund Assets Vanguard S&P 500 ETF 0.03% $806.5 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF 0.03% $292.7 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 0.0945% $371 billionThere are negligible differences between the performances of the S&P 500 index and each of these three funds that track it. The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected when accounting for each funds expense ratio. At the S&P 500s rate of return, a $10,000 investment made in early 2017 would have grown to $23,340 by the end of 2021. As the table below shows, even the worst-performing index fund of the three would have increased that $10,000 investment to $23,230 over the same five-year period.Data sources: YCharts, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors. Data as of May 10, 2022, and is representative of each funds performance as of Dec. 31, 2021. Index or Fund 1-Year Total Return 3-Year Annualized Return 5-Year Annualized Return S&P 500 Index 31.46% 26.29% 18.63% Vanguard S&P 500 ETF 31.35% 26.24% 18.54% iShares Core S&P 500 ETF 31.33% 26.24% 18.54% SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 31.28% 18.04% 18.49%With any of these three funds, you can expect your investment to deliver performance thats virtually identical to the S&P 500. The Vanguard and iShares options have the lowest expense ratios. However, if youre a fan of SPDR products, a 0.0945% expense ratio isnt high by any means. A 0.0945% expense ratio means that $9.45 of every $10,000 invested is annually collected as a management fee. One thing to be aware of is that, like the S&P 500 index, all three funds listed above are weighted by market capitalization. That means that your investment is heavily concentrated in the biggest companies. In each of the three top S&P 500 index funds, the top 10 companies represent about 30% of its holdings. If you want to invest in the quality large-cap companies in the S&P 500 while spreading out your risk a bit more, you could opt for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT:RSP). Because its an equal-weighted fund, it aims to invest the same dollar amount in each of the S&P 500 stocks. As a result, youd expect the top 10 holdings to account for just 2.5% at any given time. Beware of leveraged S&P 500 index funds Be wary of leveraged funds that are advertised as S&P 500 ETFs. Leveraged ETFs use borrowed money and/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the indexs performance each day. So if the index rises by 2%, the ETFs value rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF loses 6%. These leveraged products are intended to be day-trading instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long term. In other words, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF, over the long term, will not return twice the indexs performance. Investing in S&P 500 index funds is one of the safest ways to build wealth over time. But leveraged ETFs, even those that track the S&P 500, are highly risky and dont belong in a long-term portfolio. Related index fund topics"
s&p 500,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/investing/sp-500-tech-stocks/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The S&P 500 is supposed to be a broad representation of the US economy. So if youre plowing money into an index fund, you might think youre doing a good job of diversifying your assets.Youd be wrong. These days, its basically the S&P 5.The five largest companies in the S&P 500 -- all tech companies -- account for nearly 20% of the market value of the entire index., Google ownerandare collectively worth $4.85 trillion. Thehas a market value of around $26.7 trillion.This could be a big problem for investors who are planning for retirement or other long-term goals who dont understand the risks of having all their proverbial eggs in one basket.The last time the S&P 500 had such a high weighting in a single sector (tech) was right before the dot com bubble burst in 2000, according to Tocqueville Asset Management portfolio manager John Petrides.""Diversifying your assets is Investing 101. Spreading investments across various asset classes, stocks, regions, credit, investment type, is the one way investors can compensate for not having a crystal ball to predict the future,"" Petrides said in a reportTwo top techs worth more than four entire sectorsPetrides is especially concerned that the two largest companies in the index -- Apple and Microsoft -- each have a higher weighting in the S&P 500 than some industries.Apple and Microsoft each make up about 4.5% of the S&P 500s market value. Thats higher than the weightings for the energy, utilities, real estate and basic materials sectors.""Buying the S&P 500 Index fund today is like buying a used car without opening up the hood and taking it for a ride....do you really know what you are buying?"" Petrides said.When investors start to overload on one sector, that usually does not end well. Petrides said in an interview with CNN Business that its essentially a following the herd mentality. And hes worried that valuations for top stocks are now too high.Petrides pointed out that in addition to the high weighting for tech in 2000, financial stocks were a disproportionately large part of the index in 2007 just before the demise of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession. Energy stocks also had an unusually high concentration in 2008 before oil prices plunged.""The current sector concentration is not a forecast of impending doom, but rather a wake-up call for investors to be aware of the potential risk being taken by simply owning the market,"" Petrides said in the report.Investors who still want texposure to the broader market can look for other funds and ETFs that own the S&P 500 companies -- with a twist.Other index ETF funds lag the S&P 500S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP Money management giant Invesco, for example, has a. As the name implies, the fund takes all the stocks in the index and weights them equally.Reverse Cap Weighted U.S. Large Cap ETF RVRS And theres another ETF that turns the index on its head. Exponential ETFs manages the, which puts the highest weightings on the smallest companies.Unfortunately, both funds have lagged the performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past few years. While weighting stocks equally in a portfolio might make some inherent sense, its hard to outperform the broader market when one sector is outpacing all the others.L Brands LB Gap GPS Nordstrom JWN Macys M The strategy of putting more money into smaller S&P 500 companies seems fundamentally flawed. The Reverse Cap ETF currently has top weightings in struggling retailersand. The reason they have smaller market values? Their stocks have all plunged over the past year.With that in mind, investors may need to grin and bear it when buying a regular index fund. Yes, you have significant exposure to a quintet of tech firms. But the members of this Fab Five have justified their solid stock performance.""Having this much in tech is a concern that shouldnt be ignored. There are comparisons to the late 1990s. But we need to realize that these companies are achieving better-than-average revenue and earnings growth in a growth-starved world,"" said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard."

But it ultimately wasnt so bad for stocks – the S&P 500 more than recovered from its March depths, setting numerous record highs in the latter part of the year and finishing 2020 up 16.3%.Some S&P 500 stocks did much better than others, however.Tesla (TSLA), which didnt even join the index until late in 2020, was by far and away the indexs best performer with a 743.4% gain. The company obliterated expectations for deliveries throughout the year, putting Teslas original year-end goal of 500,000 deliveries within realistic reach.Perhaps more importantly, in July, TSLA reported its fourth consecutive quarter of turning a profit. That helped flame speculation that the company would join the ranks of the S&P 500 stocks. Also sparking retail investor interest was the companys August announcement that it would split its stock 5-for-1.Had it not been for Teslas inclusion, Etsy (ETSY, +301.6% in 2020) wouldve been the S&P 500s top stock. The online retailer, which focuses on handmade and other artisan goods, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of a huge shift to e-commerce, with the companys revenues doubling through the first nine months of 2020.Many of the S&P 500s worst stocks were unsurprisingly related to travel and energy, both of which were gashed in 2020.Carnival (CCL, -56.9% in 2020) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH, -56.5% in 2020), which were unable to operate for most of the year, were among the indexs worst stocks. So was United Airlines (UAL, -50.9% in 2020), as airlines were effectively crippled too. Energy firms such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY, -56.6% in 2020) and Marathon Oil (MRO, -50.4% in 2020) were also bottom-10 components, brutalized by oil prices that at one point turned negative for the year.You can check out the list below for a full ranking of the S&P 500s stocks based on their total return (price plus dividends).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed major benchmarks, ending 3.1% higher, with megacaps Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. bouncing back from Monday’s losses.Stocks favored by short sellers were among the biggest gainers on the day, suggesting that bearish traders were forced to cover positions moving against them. In extended trading, Netflix Inc. gained after reporting a second-quarter subscriber loss that was less than expected.With the potential for earnings disappointments baked into markets, any upside surprises may lead to outsized gains. Investors remain on high alert for signs that high inflation and monetary tightening are squeezing consumers and employment, with allocation to stocks plunging to levels last seen in October 2008 and exposure to cash surged to the highest since 2001, according to the latest Bank of America Corp.’s monthly fund manager survey.“Earnings, so far, there’s been some caution and there’s been a little bit of dialing down of expectations, but I don’t think the worst-case scenarios are really in play anymore,” Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade, said in an interview. “We’ve heard from the big banks, we’ve heard from IBM, we’ve heard from Johnson & Johnson, we’ve heard from enough companies that have had a big enough footprint that if there is something at the macro level severely impacting these businesses, it would have shown up in a lot of these earnings.”Story continuesOn the earnings front, Hasbro Inc., the largest US toy company, gained after earnings beat analyst estimates, while International Business Machines Corp. fell as the tech company lowered its forecasts for free cash flow.

But I believe we are far closer to the bottom than the top.”“There is a growing feeling in the market that the gradual and cautious normalization process the ECB started at the end of 2021 has been the wrong decision and that to make up for that slow and late,” wrote Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index. “Indeed, even until its June meeting, the ECB was pre-committing to a 25-basis point hike in July. But with the broad weakening of the euro helping to import more inflation in the eurozone, the ECB could surprise with a 50 bp hike.”“Sharp dollar pullback has boosted equities,” Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a note.”But the dollar rally was extended and due for a pullback (it can’t go up in a straight line) just like it was in late April.

The Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have also slid, tumbling around 28% and 16% year-to-date, respectively. It comes after a rough first half of the year — the worst since 1970 — as recession fears and hot inflation caused investors to flee stocks. At what level will the S & P 500 trough? The S & P 500 closed at 3,863.16 on Friday — and Wilson says that if a recession occurs, the trough in the S & P 500 will likely be around the 3,000 level. In a soft landing scenario, however, in which a recession is avoided, he expects the bottom to come around 3,400. However, he stressed that the strong dollar poses a significant headwind to the index. ""The S & P 500 is very levered to currency,"" said Wilson. ""Right now [the dollar is] up 17% year-over-year, and we think it could even go higher until the Fed pivots. So youre looking at somewhere between 8% to 10% headwinds for S & P earnings growth.""

Average and median returns tended to be rather negative over 5 to 20 days, he found, though most of the incidents saw positive returns 30 days out (see charts below).BTIGA retreat by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.34% , which had hit a 20-year high last week, and a pullback in recent weeks by Treasury yields have allowed stocks and other so-called risk assets to gain some ground, but it’s “far too soon to say their trends have reversed,” Krinsky said, warning that a rise in dollar or yields could see equities come under renewed pressure.“Our view remains the same here that rallies towards 4,000-4,100 should be viewed as an opportunity to reduce risk ahead of a breakdown later this summer,” he said.Read: Why the analyst who called summer stock-market bounce now sees more S&P 500 upside"
s&p 500,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/santoli-the-sp-500-lifted-by-earnings-makes-a-run-at-a-key-threshold-and-tests-its-downtrend.html,"This is the daily notebook of Mike Santoli, CNBCs senior markets commentator, with ideas about trends, stocks and market statistics. Stocks make another run at the high end of the range as asset markets collectively step back from the ""recession is near"" scenario, with reports that natural gas will resume flowing into Europe part of the push. The S & P 500 hustles above 3,900. Credit spreads rush tighter. The dollar is down for a third straight day, and Treasury yields up and a bit less inverted from 2- to 10-year maturities. The net effect is a test of the downtrend line for the S & P, above yesterdays high, with many citing 3,915 as an initial hurdle toward a more credible advance: High-yield corporate spreads touched 600 basis points (six percentage points above comparable Treasury yields) and reversed lower, now sitting near the late-2018 ""recession/Fed overtightening scare"" levels. Certainly not a ringing endorsement of the outlook or huge support for higher equity valuations, but a healthy retracement of the recent widening. In the background, the results of the monthly Bank of America global fund manager survey are in heavy rotation today, showing economic sentiment at washout levels of pessimism even if equity exposures/fund flows are a bit short of full surrender. Theres no denying the professional investment community entered this quarter having cut risk exposures to multiyear lows. The equity market acts as if this is the case, with jumpy up moves and so far over a month since hitting a new low. A small contingent victory, but its not nothing. Big picture: The equity trend is objectively lower. Itll be hard to disprove the recession scenario for months even if we dont get one. The Fed is demanding months of data before easing back on the hawkish intent, and stocks have merely returned to the zone of ""fair value"" not outright cheap. All are reasons to stay cautious or keep expectations low. With all that, though, it remains a net positive that so few seem willing to suggest the mid-June market low could prove consequential. Large speculative funds are decisively net short index futures. Meantime, corporate insiders are leaning heavily on the buy side, which typically is a bullish sign eventually if not immediately, as SentimenTrader shows here: Earnings reactions are the typical mix so far, but with a slight flavor of relief and a sense of ""couldve been worse"" in aggregate. Still no critical mass of reports in the books. Currency headwinds are a theme, but the market tends to look past those if its strictly about the translation of FX revenue as opposed to serious demand shortfalls. Market breadth is quite strong: a chance at a 90% upside volume day on NYSE, which so soon after Fridays 90% advancing volume would register under some systems as a strong demand signal that should be respected. VIX is sagging toward 24. Under that level would be a plus, sinking below the recent range in a sign of steadiness/better risk tone. Still much to prove for the bulls, but a few things are ""less bad"" in the immediate term. Earnings season, all else being equal, should pressure VIX lower, with more divergence among individual stocks which can neutralize index-level volatility (which is what VIX is based on)."
s&p 500,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523796-sp-500-may-drop-sharply-as-vix-surge-nears,"Michael Ver Sprill/iStock via Getty ImagesStocks had a solid finish to the week, thanks to options expiration. But if it had not been for the monthly options expiration, last week would have been a disaster. The S&P 500 (SP500) was down more than 4% at its lows on Thursday morning but finished the week lower by around 1%. The end-of-week comeback was aided by the slow melt of the VIX index (VIX).Options expiration managed to keep the markets afloat and did not allow the S&P 500 to drift too far from the significant open interest levels around the 3,800 and 3,850 levels. As the market drifted lower during the week, the higher strike prices gravity helped lift the index higher throughout Thursday and Friday.CBOE Live Vol/ Trade AlertThat is primarily why the S&P 500 was stuck between 3,845 and 3,860 on Friday after 11 AM. It only managed to move higher in the final 5 minutes of the trading session and closed just above 3,860.Trading ViewMonday starts a new options cycle, meaning the push and pull of options start over, and the market will be free to move much more easily. Open interest levels for the S&P 500 will be nearly cut in half with the removal of the July 15 trade date.CBOE Live Vol/ Trade AlertAdditionally, there was a consistent decline in implied volatility levels in the S&P 500 throughout the week. The big intraday rebounds witnessed on Wednesday and Thursday were helped by falling implied volatility throughout the day. It would suggest the intraday price action was more mechanical and options related than due to the underlying macro backdrop.BloombergMacro Factors Forgotten For NowThe macro backdrop this past week was very negative. The CPI report came in much hotter than expected. The market is now betting on a 75 and 100 bps rate hike at the end of July. The odds of a 75 bps rate hike now stand around 70%, while a 100 bps rate hike stands around 30%.CMEWhile retail sales were better than expected, rising by 1.0% month-over-month versus estimates of 0.9%, they were still well below the CPI month-over-month gain of 1.3%. That means retail sales were down 0.3% on a month-over-month basis in real terms. Even on a year-over-year basis, retail sales were negative, rising 8.4%, below the 9.1% year-over-year gain in CPI. In real terms, retail sales fell 0.7% year-over-year and were negative for the fourth straight month. While the declines to this point are modest, it is rare for retail sales to be negative year-over-year in real terms. It has only previously happened in recessions.BloombergOn top of this, the data out of China was just as bad, with second quarter GDP missing consensus estimates by a wide margin, rising by just 0.4%, well short of forecasts for 1.2%. This news was unnoticed by US markets during Fridays trading session. Still, it didnt go unnoticed in Asia, with CSI 300 index dropping by around 4% last week and the HK Hang Seng index dropping approximately 6.6%.BloombergIf that werent enough, Europe had its problems, with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi announcing his intentions to resign. The news caused the Italian 2-year yield to explode higher, which sent the euro sharply lower versus the dollar.BloombergThe euro is trading at its lowest point versus the dollar in nearly 20 years and at parity with the dollar. Couple that with Chinas weak economic data and Japans reluctance to come off its negative interest rate policy and yield curve control, the dollar has strengthened versus the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi too.BloombergImplied Volatility Saves The DayThe macro backdrop did not support stocks rising and is a big reason markets were down sharply on Wednesday and Thursday morning. But once implied volatility and the VIX index began to melt, stocks got a boost right into Fridays close.BloombergStress BuildsBut not all is well beneath the surface. As noted by the spread between the 3-Month USD Libor Rate and the US Effective Fed Funds Rate, a sign of stress may have shown its head in the overnight lending markets. The spread is not high compared to peaks in 2018, 2019, or 2020, but it is at its widest point since Russia invaded Ukraine and needs to be watched closely. The widening spread can signal increased equity market volatility.BloombergGiven this backdrop, the melt of implied volatility is likely to change this week as the market moves past the VIX options expiration and begins to focus on macro issues along with a European Central Bank and Bank of Japan meeting this week, along with the FOMC meeting on July 27.FOMC Cycle Should Kick InThe period after the FOMC meeting tends to be bullish. The only period that didnt see a rally post-FOMC came following the May meeting. Otherwise, we have seen relatively big rallies following the FOMC meeting this year. But the period before the FOMC meeting can be very turbulent, especially 6 to 9 days before the meeting.Trading ViewVolatility Rising?The rallies after the FOMC meeting are usually because the VIX is elevated heading into that meeting. After all, the FOMC meeting creates an event risk. Therefore, traders look to put hedges in place by buying puts, pushing implied volatility up and, as a result, causing the VIX to go higher and stock prices down about 6 to 10 days before the FOMC meeting. Once the event risk passes, there is no reason to have hedges anymore, causing implied volatility to fall and for the market to rally.The VIX appears to be set up similar to how it was at the June FOMC meeting. With volatility melting lower, there is potential to push significantly higher between now and the FOMC meeting.Trading ViewInterestingly, there has been a turn-up in 10-day realized volatility in the S&P 500. When the spread between 10-day realized volatility and S&P 500 30-day implied volatility widens by about 5 percentage points, it tends to push realized volatility higher, pulling implied volatility higher, which is bearish for stocks.BloombergCan the market continue to rally, sure? But there continue to be many more reasons for it not to rally. Given several geopolitical factors, along with an upcoming central bank meeting from the ECB and BOJ this week and the FOMC next week, the risk for further downside pain is not over yet."

The benchmark closed in bear market territory (down more than 20% from its high) after trading there briefly on an intraday basis about three weeks ago. Some on Wall Street say its not an official bear market until the index closes there and thats what happened on Monday. The last time stocks were in a bear market was in March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 876.05 points, or 2.79%, to settle at 30,516.74, about 17% off its record high. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.68% to close at 10,809.23, bringing its losses for this sell-off to more than 33%. Major averages hit their lows of the session in the final 30 minutes after a Wall Street Journal report suggested the Fed would consider raising rates by 0.75% on Wednesday, more than the half-point increase currently expected. There were few places to hide on Monday as Treasury bond prices dropped, pushing the 10-year yield to its largest one-day move since March 2020. Bitcoin was slammed by 15%.

All major S&P 500 sectors dipped into the red led by energy, which fell more than 5%. Consumer discretionary, communication services, information technology and utilities all dropped more than 4%. The dramatic moves lower could indicate that many investors are profit-taking or repositioning their portfolios, and may signal that markets are in ""a capitulation stage,"" said Jeff Kilburg, chief investment officer of Sanctuary Wealth.CNBCAs equities sold off short-term rates jumped on Monday. The 10-year Treasury rose more than 20 basis points higher to top 3.3%, as investors continued to bet the Fed may have to get more aggressive to squash inflation. Prices move inversely to yields and 1 basis point equals 0.01%. The 2-year Treasury yield was last up roughly 30 basis points to about 3.3%. Mondays moves came after the major averages last week posted their biggest weekly declines since late January as investors grew increasingly concerned rising inflation will tip the economy into a recession. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. consumer price index rose last month by 8.6% from a year ago, its fastest increase since December 1981. That gain topped economists expectations. Gasoline prices also hit above $5 a gallon over the weekend, further fanning fears over rising inflation and falling consumer confidence.Crypto crushedMeanwhile, bitcoin tumbled below $24,000 on Monday and hit its lowest level since 2020 as risk-averse investors continued to dump crypto as rates rise. The news sent shared of crypto-related companies including Coinbase and Microstrategy down 11% and 25%, respectively. ""The cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a great gauge of investors risk threshold for equities,"" wrote JC OHara, chief market technician at MKM Partners. ""Plenty of longs who bought in last year are still trapped, and thus we could easily see a pullback to 19,500. That would be a bearish read through for stocks.""Investors are looking ahead to Wednesday when the Fed is expected to announce at least a half-point rate hike. The central bank has already raised rates twice this year, including a 50-basis-point increase in May in an effort to stave off the recent inflation surge. Some economists believe the Fed could even raise rates by 0.75% this week following Fridays CPI report.Time to play defense"

The S&P 500 tracks performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.AdvertisementThe changes are being made to “ensure each index is more representative of its market capitalization range,” S&P Dow Jones said in an announcement.“All companies moving from the S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space, and all companies moving from the S&P MidCap 400 to the S&P SmallCap 600 are more representative of the small-cap market space,” the announcement said.AdvertisementMarket capitalization is the total market value of a publicly traded company’s outstanding shares. Under Armour’s market cap is about $4.86 billion.Shares of Under Armour have lost nearly half their value this year but rose a nickel Monday to $11.05 each.The retailer posted a quarterly loss May 6 and missed revenue projections amid continuing supply chain and pandemic-related challenges.

s&p 500,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/03/is-it-time-to-buy-the-sp-500s-4-worst-performing-s/,"Warren Buffett said to never try to time stock picks perfectly, but if you do, attempt to ""be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy.""After the worst quarter for the S&P 500 since the first quarter of 2020, many top stocks are down significantly. And the four worst-performing stocks last quarter included some very popular names, including Netflix (NFLX 7.34%), PayPal (PYPL 3.22%), and Etsy (ETSY 5.97%). On top of these well-known consumer discretionary stocks, technology consulting firm EPAM Systems (EPAM -1.81%) took the crown for the worst-performing stock in the index.So should you buy these stocks while the fear is high?Pandemic tailwinds are turning into headwinds for Netflix, PayPal, and EtsyIn the first quarter, Netflix was down 37.8%, PayPal was down 38.7%, and Etsy was down 43.2%. These stay-at-home growth stocks buoyed by the pandemic reversed course in a big way in 2022, as they were hit by a double-whammy. Not only is growth decelerating as the pandemic pulled forward demand for these stocks, but inflation has spiked. Thats led to rising interest rates, which lowers the value of earnings further out into the future. Future earnings make up the bulk of the intrinsic value of growth stocks, so pandemic beneficiaries have been doubly punished.All three companies reported decent fourth quarters, but the problem was guidance. Netflix guided to lower-than-expected subscriber growth, with CEO Reed Hastings saying, ""Were just, like, staying calm and trying to figure out."" Not exactly encouraging. With the streaming industry becoming more competitive as other services have launched, some are now questioning how many subscribers Netflix will be able to add and ultimately keep -- especially as it recently raised prices.Meanwhile, the move away from purchasing goods during the pandemic to more experiential services could also hurt Etsys results. Etsys growth decelerated to 16.2% in the fourth quarter, versus 35% for the full year 2021. Even worse, the company only guided to only 4.9% growth in the current quarter, with even lower margins on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) basis.Like Netflix, Etsy has raised prices to maintain revenue growth, but its having some blowback. Last week, 8,000 Etsy sellers signed a petition protesting Etsys new take rate increases, which are set to rise from 5% to 6.5% in April. Adding fuel to the fire, Loop Capital analyst Laura Champine downgraded the stock in recent days on yet another headwind: inflation in online advertising, which Etsy uses to acquire customers. Overall, its been an ugly quarter for Etsy, which is facing multiple difficulties.Finally, PayPal is suffering from some of the same headwinds as Etsy and Netflix, although it has some company-specific headwinds as well. Most notably, its losing revenue from its largest customer in eBay (EBAY 1.78%), which used to be PayPals parent company and exclusive partner. eBay is transitioning to another payment provider, which has lowered revenue to PayPal and hit PayPals growth in recent quarters. Meanwhile, the omicron variant and geopolitical tensions are threatening PayPals profitable cross-border revenue. On top of that, management admitted it was abandoning its long-term user goals, as PayPal is now pulling back on advertising to low-usage new customers to focus on keeping higher-frequency users more engaged.Yet of these three, PayPal would actually be my pick for the best buy at this current moment, even though Netflix is the only of the three I own -- a small position Ive held for a long time.PayPal is still generating enough free cash flow to buy back a significant amount of stock, and its forward P/E ratio is the lowest of the three. Furthermore, PayPal could reaccelerate revenue in the back half of this year, as the effect of the eBay revenue declines should be over by midyear. That catalyst could certainly help the stock, while I dont see a distinct catalyst for the other two.ETSY PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsEPAM Systems is interesting here as wellFinally, EPAM Systems may be worth a look, as it was down the most of any stock in the S&P 500, plunging 57.1% in the first quarter. Similar to the other three, the company has been a beneficiary of rapid digital transformation, but on the enterprise side. A mixture of consulting, engineering, and design, EPAM helps companies design, build, and implement new technology systems and train employees.Obviously, digital transformation was a hot topic during the pandemic, and EPAMs stock soared as a result, entering the S&P 500 index last year.EPAM, like many other highly valued stocks, took its lumps as the interest rate and inflation outlook changed. However, the stock took yet another leg down at the end of February, after management pulled its first-quarter guidance immediately following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. EPAM also announced it was pulling out of Russia, where it served some businesses -- but not the government. EPAM also committed $100 million to help employees in Ukraine and their families.EPAM is profitable and had initially guided for adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share to rise 27.3% this year at the midpoint, to $11.52 per share. Thats a deceleration after last years scorching 42.7% EPS growth, but its still pretty darn good.While Im not as familiar with EPAM, this sell-off could be an opportunity. Technology consulting is an asset-light growth business, and with the stock down so much, its worth a look. Its true that the company may not hit its earnings target this year, but Russia was probably only a small part of its business. Russias GDP is tiny, and EPAM operates in more than 40 countries. While European tech projects may be put on hold, digital transformation will continue to march forward. After losing more than half its value already this year, EPAM is a tech stock Ill be following going forward, and maybe buying in the near future."
